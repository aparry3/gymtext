# Repository Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The repository has been refactored to follow the proposed directory structure from `docs/directory-structure.md` with additional improvements for better organization and maintainability.

## Major Changes

### 1. API Routes Reorganization
- ✅ Moved `/api/webhook` → `/api/checkout/callback`
- ✅ Moved `/api/auth/session` → `/api/checkout/session`
- ✅ Moved `/api/create-checkout-session` → `/api/checkout/route.ts`
- **Improvement**: Grouped related checkout functionality under a single namespace

### 2. Components Restructuring
- ✅ Created `/components/pages/` directory for page-level components
- ✅ Moved `SignUpForm.tsx` → `/components/pages/SignUp/index.tsx`
- ✅ Moved `WorkoutPlanViewer.tsx` → `/components/pages/FitnessPlanViewer/index.tsx`
- ✅ Added SCSS modules for each page component
- **Improvement**: Clear separation between UI components and page components

### 3. Server-Side Architecture
- ✅ Moved `/server/data/repositories/` → `/server/repositories/`
- ✅ Created `/server/models/` with domain models exposing Kysely types
- ✅ Moved generated Kysely types to `/server/models/_types/`
- ✅ Reorganized connections:
  - `/server/core/database/postgres.ts` → `/server/connections/postgres/`
  - `/server/core/database/vector.ts` → `/server/connections/pinecone/`
  - `/server/core/clients/twilio.ts` → `/server/connections/twilio/`
- **Improvement**: Clear separation of concerns between models, repositories, and connections

### 4. Agent System Refactoring
- ✅ Created dedicated directories for each agent with `chain.ts` and `prompts.ts`:
  - `/server/agents/fitnessPlanCreation/`
  - `/server/agents/mesocycleBreakdown/`
  - `/server/agents/welcomeMessage/`
  - `/server/agents/dailyMessage/`
  - `/server/agents/chat/`
- ✅ Split monolithic `prompts/templates.ts` into agent-specific prompt files
- **Improvement**: Better modularity and easier maintenance of agent logic

### 5. Test Organization
- ✅ Created `/tests/` directory at root level
- ✅ Moved embedded tests from `__tests__` folders to mirror source structure
- **Improvement**: Clear separation between source code and tests

### 6. Additional Improvements (Beyond Original Spec)

#### Configuration Management
- ✅ Created `/src/config/` with centralized configuration
- **Benefits**: 
  - Type-safe environment variable access
  - Centralized configuration management
  - Environment validation

#### Constants
- ✅ Created `/src/constants/` for application-wide constants
- **Benefits**:
  - Single source of truth for magic numbers/strings
  - Better maintainability
  - Type safety with `as const`

#### Middleware
- ✅ Created `/src/middleware/` with error handling utilities
- **Benefits**:
  - Consistent error handling across API routes
  - Reusable async handler wrapper
  - Structured error responses

#### Hooks Directory
- ✅ Created `/src/hooks/` (placeholder for future React hooks)
- **Benefits**: Ready for custom hook development

## Import Path Updates
All import paths have been updated to reflect the new structure:
- `@/server/data/repositories/` → `@/server/repositories/`
- `@/server/core/database/postgres` → `@/server/connections/postgres`
- `@/server/core/database/vector` → `@/server/connections/pinecone`
- `@/server/core/clients/twilio` → `@/server/connections/twilio`
- `@/shared/types/generated` → `@/server/models/_types`
- Component imports updated to new page structure

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated directories for different types of code
2. **Improved Modularity**: Agent system is now modular with separate chain and prompt files
3. **Easier Testing**: Tests are organized in a mirror structure, making it easy to find related tests
4. **Type Safety**: Models expose Kysely types with additional business logic
5. **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration with validation
6. **Scalability**: Structure supports growth with clear patterns for adding new features
7. **Developer Experience**: Easier to navigate and understand the codebase

## Next Steps

1. Update any remaining hardcoded environment variables to use the new config system
2. Add unit tests for the new model layer
3. Consider adding integration tests for the agent chains
4. Update documentation to reflect the new structure
5. Consider adding API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`) for future compatibility
