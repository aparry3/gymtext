# Repository Reorganization Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Created New Modular Structure
- Established a domain-driven design approach with clear separation of concerns
- Created the following directory structure:
  ```
  src/modules/
  ├── user/
  ├── fitness/
  ├── conversation/
  ├── workout/
  └── ai/
  ```

### 2. Moved Generated Types
- Relocated `generated.ts` from `src/shared/types/` to `src/shared/database/generated/`
- This separates auto-generated database types from hand-written domain models

### 3. Implemented User Module
Created a complete example implementation for the User module:

#### Domain Layer
- **Models**: `User.ts`, `FitnessProfile.ts` - Pure domain entities with business logic
- **Interfaces**: `IUserRepository.ts`, `IUserService.ts` - Contracts for data access and business logic

#### Infrastructure Layer
- **Repository**: `UserRepository.ts` - Implements data access using Kysely
- **Mapper**: `UserMapper.ts` - Converts between database entities and domain models

#### Application Layer
- **Service**: `UserService.ts` - Implements business logic and orchestration

#### API Layer
- **DTOs**: `UserDto.ts` - Data transfer objects for external communication
- **Mapper**: `UserDtoMapper.ts` - Converts between domain models and DTOs

### 4. Started Fitness Module
- Created `FitnessPlan.ts` and `Mesocycle.ts` domain models
- Demonstrated how complex types can be modeled independently of database schema

### 5. Documentation
- Created `REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed plan for the new structure
- Created `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step guide for migrating existing code

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Database logic is isolated in repositories
   - Business logic is contained in services
   - Domain models are independent of infrastructure

2. **Type Safety**
   - Each layer has its own type definitions
   - Mappers ensure safe conversion between layers
   - Generated types are clearly separated

3. **Testability**
   - Interfaces allow easy mocking
   - Domain models can be tested independently
   - Services can be tested without database

4. **Maintainability**
   - Changes to database schema only affect mappers
   - Business logic is isolated from infrastructure changes
   - Clear boundaries between modules

## Next Steps

1. **Complete remaining modules** (fitness, conversation, workout, ai)
2. **Update existing code** to use the new structure
3. **Add dependency injection** for better testability
4. **Create module-specific documentation**
5. **Update API routes** to use the new DTOs
6. **Add comprehensive tests** for each layer

## Example Usage

```typescript
// Old way - mixed concerns
const user = await db.selectFrom('users').where('id', '=', userId).executeTakeFirst();

// New way - clear separation
const userRepo = new UserRepository(db);
const userService = new UserService(userRepo);
const user = await userService.getUserById(userId);
const userDto = UserDtoMapper.toUserResponse(user);
```

The new structure provides a solid foundation for scaling the application while maintaining code quality and developer productivity.
