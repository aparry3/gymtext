# Phase 5: Configuration Cleanup - Complete ✅

## What We Accomplished

### Configuration Changes

1. **Removed Unused Variables**:
   - ❌ `MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` - No longer needed (was only used in backup)
   - ❌ `LLM_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` env var - Not referenced anywhere in active code
   
2. **Kept Essential Config**:
   - ✅ `SMS_MAX_LENGTH` - Still used for response truncation in chatService.ts:36

3. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Removed empty constructor from ChatService class (lines 9-10)
   - Service now cleaner with just the essential method

### Environment Variables Status

**Still Needed**:
- `SMS_MAX_LENGTH` - For SMS truncation (default: 1600)
- All other env vars in .env.example remain valid for their respective services

**No Longer Needed**:
- `LLM_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` - Agent handles token limits internally

## Verification

- ✅ Build passes
- ✅ Lint passes
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Configuration simplified

## Code Quality Improvements

### Before
- Empty constructor taking up space
- Unused MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS constant in backup

### After
- Cleaner class definition
- Only essential configuration remains
- SMS_MAX_LENGTH properly documented with default value

## Next Steps

Phase 5 is complete. Configuration has been cleaned up. Ready to proceed with:
- Phase 6: Testing (unit and integration tests)
- Phase 7: Validation
- Phase 8: Future Enhancements
