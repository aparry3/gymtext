# Activity-Specific Profile Enhancement: Final Recommendation

## Executive Summary

To enhance GymText's onboarding conversations and program generation with activity-specific context, we recommend adding **two simple fields** to the existing FitnessProfile schema. This approach provides 90% of the benefits with minimal complexity and maximum scalability.

## Recommended Implementation

### Schema Changes

Add these fields to the existing `FitnessProfile` interface:

```typescript
interface FitnessProfile {
  // ... all existing fields remain unchanged
  
  // NEW: Activity-specific enhancements
  activityData?: ActivityData
}

// Discriminated union based on activity type
type ActivityData = 
  | HikingData 
  | RunningData 
  | StrengthData 
  | CyclingData
  | SkiingData
  | GeneralActivityData

interface HikingData {
  type: 'hiking'
  experienceLevel?: string
  keyMetrics?: {
    longestHike?: number
    elevationComfort?: string
    packWeight?: number
    weeklyHikes?: number
  }
  equipment?: string[]
  goals?: string[]
  experience?: string
  lastUpdated?: Date
}

interface RunningData {
  type: 'running'
  experienceLevel?: string
  keyMetrics?: {
    weeklyMileage?: number
    longestRun?: number
    averagePace?: string
    racesCompleted?: number
  }
  equipment?: string[]
  goals?: string[]
  experience?: string
  lastUpdated?: Date
}

interface StrengthData {
  type: 'strength'
  experienceLevel?: string
  keyMetrics?: {
    benchPress?: number
    squat?: number
    deadlift?: number
    trainingDays?: number
  }
  equipment?: string[]
  goals?: string[]
  experience?: string
  lastUpdated?: Date
}

interface CyclingData {
  type: 'cycling'
  experienceLevel?: string
  keyMetrics?: {
    weeklyHours?: number
    longestRide?: number
    avgSpeed?: number
    terrainTypes?: string[]
  }
  equipment?: string[]
  goals?: string[]
  experience?: string
  lastUpdated?: Date
}

interface SkiingData {
  type: 'skiing'
  experienceLevel?: string
  keyMetrics?: {
    daysPerSeason?: number
    terrainComfort?: string[]
    verticalPerDay?: number
  }
  equipment?: string[]
  goals?: string[]
  experience?: string
  lastUpdated?: Date
}

interface GeneralActivityData {
  type: 'other'
  activityName?: string                       // Custom activity name
  experienceLevel?: string
  keyMetrics?: Record<string, string | number> // Flexible for unknown activities
  equipment?: string[]
  goals?: string[]
  experience?: string
  lastUpdated?: Date
}
```

### No Database Migration Required! üéâ

Since `FitnessProfile` is already stored as a JSON field in the database, **no migration is needed**. Simply update the TypeScript interface and start using the new fields immediately.

```typescript
// Database schema remains unchanged - FitnessProfile is JSON
users: {
  profile: JSONB  // Already supports arbitrary JSON structure
}

// Just update the TypeScript interface - single field with discriminated union
interface FitnessProfile {
  // ... existing fields remain unchanged
  activityData?: ActivityData    // ‚Üê Single new field with type discrimination
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Hiking Profile
```typescript
{
  activityData: {
    type: 'hiking',
    experienceLevel: 'day-hiker',
    keyMetrics: {
      longestHike: 15,           // miles
      elevationComfort: 'moderate',
      packWeight: 25,            // lbs
      weeklyHikes: 2
    },
    equipment: ['hiking boots', 'backpack', 'trekking poles'],
    goals: ['Grand Canyon rim-to-rim', 'improve endurance'],
    experience: 'I hike most weekends, comfortable with 10-15 mile day hikes with moderate elevation. Never done overnight backpacking.'
  }
}
```

### Running Profile
```typescript
{
  activityData: {
    type: 'running',
    experienceLevel: 'recreational',
    keyMetrics: {
      weeklyMileage: 25,
      longestRun: 13,            // miles
      averagePace: '8:30',       // min/mile
      racesCompleted: 3
    },
    equipment: ['running shoes', 'GPS watch'],
    goals: ['first marathon', 'sub-4:00 finish'],
    experience: 'Running consistently for 2 years, completed several half marathons, looking to step up to full marathon distance.'
  }
}
```

### Strength Training Profile
```typescript
{
  activityData: {
    type: 'strength',
    experienceLevel: 'intermediate',
    keyMetrics: {
      benchPress: 185,           // lbs
      squat: 225,               // lbs  
      deadlift: 275,            // lbs
      trainingDays: 4           // per week
    },
    equipment: ['barbell', 'squat rack', 'bench'],
    goals: ['increase squat to 315', 'improve form'],
    experience: 'Been lifting for 18 months, comfortable with main compound movements, want to focus on progressive overload.'
  }
}
```

### Custom Activity Profile
```typescript
{
  activityData: {
    type: 'other',
    activityName: 'rock climbing',
    experienceLevel: 'intermediate',
    keyMetrics: {
      hardestGrade: '5.10a',
      climbingDays: 3,           // per week
      yearsExperience: 2
    },
    equipment: ['harness', 'shoes', 'chalk bag'],
    goals: ['climb 5.11', 'lead outdoor routes'],
    experience: 'Indoor climbing for 2 years, starting to transition outdoors.'
  }
}
```

## Agent Integration Strategy

### 1. Profile Extraction Enhancement

Update the profile extraction agent to detect and populate activity-specific data:

```typescript
// In profile agent prompts
"When users mention specific activities, extract:
- activityData.type: The primary activity they're focused on
- activityData.experienceLevel: Their experience in THAT activity (not general fitness)
- activityData.keyMetrics: Activity-relevant numbers (miles, weights, times, frequencies)
- activityData.experience: Free-form description of their background in this activity"
```

### 2. Onboarding Chat Enhancement

Update contextual gap detection to use activity-specific information:

```typescript
// Enhanced gap detection with type safety
if (profile.activityData?.type === 'hiking') {
  const hikingData = profile.activityData as HikingData;
  if (!hikingData.keyMetrics?.longestHike) {
    gaps.push('hiking-distance-experience');
  }
}

if (profile.activityData?.type === 'running') {
  const runningData = profile.activityData as RunningData;
  if (!runningData.keyMetrics?.weeklyMileage) {
    gaps.push('running-volume-experience');
  }
}
```

### 3. Activity-Specific Question Templates

Create question templates per activity type:

```typescript
const activityQuestions = {
  hiking: [
    "What's the longest day hike you've completed?",
    "Are you comfortable with elevation gain and descents?", 
    "Have you done any overnight backpacking?"
  ],
  running: [
    "How many miles do you typically run per week?",
    "What's the longest distance you've run?",
    "Have you completed any races?"
  ],
  strength: [
    "What are your current main lifts (squat, bench, deadlift)?",
    "How many days per week do you lift?",
    "Are you comfortable with barbell movements?"
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Phases
