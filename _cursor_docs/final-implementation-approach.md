## Implementation Details

### ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

#### ‚úÖ Schema Enhancement (src/server/models/user/index.ts)
Successfully added discriminated union `ActivityData` types to the existing `FitnessProfile` interface:

```typescript
// Activity-specific data types for enhanced profile intelligence
export type ActivityData = 
  | HikingData 
  | RunningData 
  | StrengthData 
  | CyclingData
  | SkiingData
  | GeneralActivityData;

// Added to FitnessProfile interface:
interface FitnessProfile {
  // ... all existing fields remain unchanged
  activityData?: ActivityData  // Single new optional field
}
```

**‚úÖ Key Advantages Achieved:**
- **‚úÖ Zero database migration**: FitnessProfile is stored as JSONB, supports arbitrary structure
- **‚úÖ Type safety**: Discriminated union enables TypeScript pattern matching
- **‚úÖ Backward compatibility**: Optional field, existing profiles unchanged

- **‚úÖ API Route**: Updated to accept and pass `conversationHistory` parameter
- **‚úÖ Onboarding Service**: Processes recent messages for context-aware profile extraction
- **‚úÖ Profile Agent**: Uses `recentMessages` for contextual profile prompts when available

### üéØ NEXT PHASE RECOMMENDATIONS

#### Phase 3: Profile Agent Integration & Cross-Activity Intelligence (2-3 days)

##### 3.1 ‚ö†Ô∏è Activity-Specific Extraction Testing (2-3 hours)
**PRIORITY: Validate current implementation** - Test that activity detection is working correctly:

**Test Messages to Verify Activity Detection:**
- `"Help me train for ski season"` ‚Üí Should detect skiing activity
- `"Training for Grand Canyon hike"` ‚Üí Should detect hiking activity  
- `"Want to run my first marathon"` ‚Üí Should detect running activity
- `"Getting back into lifting weights"` ‚Üí Should detect strength activity

**What to Validate:**
1. Profile agent correctly populates `activityData.type` field
2. Activity-specific questions are generated in onboarding chat
3. Gap detection identifies activity-specific missing information
4. Profile summary includes activity context in conversations

##### 3.2 Cross-Activity Intelligence (3-4 hours)
**PRIORITY: Implement fitness level inference** from activity-specific experience:
- Marathon completion ‚Üí intermediate+ endurance fitness
- Powerlifting experience ‚Üí advanced strength training
- Weekly hiking ‚Üí good cardiovascular base
- Ski racing background ‚Üí advanced athletic performance

##### 3.3 Progressive Profile Building Validation (2-3 hours)
**PRIORITY: Test conversation flows** that build activity profiles progressively:
1. Initial activity detection and basic data collection
2. Follow-up questions for missing critical metrics
3. Equipment and goal refinement
4. Experience validation and gap filling

#### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (1-2 days)

##### 4.1 Core Activity Testing (4-6 hours)
Test conversation flows for primary activities:
- **Hiking**: Grand Canyon preparation, weekend hiking, backpacking goals
- **Running**: Marathon training, 5K improvement, race preparation
- **Strength**: Powerlifting goals, general gym fitness, compound movement focus
- **Skiing**: Season preparation, technique improvement, terrain progression

##### 4.2 Edge Case Handling (2-3 hours)
- Mixed activity goals (skiing + strength training)
- Activity transitions (runner wanting to start hiking)
- Vague objectives requiring clarification
- Unknown activities requiring custom handling

##### 4.3 Validation & Safety (1-2 hours)
- Confidence threshold testing for activity classification
- Graceful degradation when activity detection fails
- Data consistency validation across profile updates

### Data Flow Architecture

1. **Input Processing**: User messages analyzed for activity indicators
2. **Activity Detection**: Profile agent identifies primary activity type
3. **Structured Extraction**: Activity-specific data extracted into typed structure
4. **Gap Analysis**: Missing fields identified using type-safe logic
5. **Question Generation**: Activity-appropriate follow-ups generated
6. **Profile Updates**: Structured data stored in existing JSON field

### Type Safety Strategy

```typescript
// Pattern matching for type-safe operations
function processActivityData(activityData: ActivityData) {
  switch (activityData.type) {
    case 'hiking':
      return processHikingData(activityData); // TypeScript knows this is HikingData
    case 'running':
      return processRunningData(activityData); // TypeScript knows this is RunningData
    // ... other cases
  }
}
```

### Backward Compatibility Approach

- Existing profiles without `activityData` continue to work unchanged
- Legacy gap detection logic remains as fallback
- Gradual migration as users engage in new conversations
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Success Metrics & Validation
