# Phase 1 Implementation Progress

## Overview
Successfully implemented Phase 1 of the activity-specific profile enhancement as outlined in `final-implementation-approach.md`. This phase provides the foundational types, schemas, and logic needed for activity-specific intelligence in GymText conversations.

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Schema Enhancement (✅ Completed)
**Location**: `src/server/models/user/index.ts`
**Changes**:
- Added comprehensive `ActivityData` discriminated union type with 6 activity types:
  - `HikingData` - with metrics like longestHike, elevationComfort, packWeight, weeklyHikes
  - `RunningData` - with metrics like weeklyMileage, longestRun, averagePace, racesCompleted
  - `StrengthData` - with metrics like trainingDays, benchPress, squat, deadlift, overhead
  - `CyclingData` - with metrics like weeklyHours, longestRide, averageSpeed, terrainTypes
  - `SkiingData` - with metrics like daysPerSeason, terrainComfort, yearsSkiing, mountainTypes
  - `GeneralActivityData` - flexible structure for any custom activity

- Added optional `activityData?: ActivityData` field to `FitnessProfile` interface
- All changes maintain backward compatibility (no breaking changes)

### 2. Zod Validation Schemas (✅ Completed)
**Location**: `src/server/models/user/schemas.ts`
**Changes**:
- Created comprehensive Zod validation schemas for all activity data types:
  - `HikingDataSchema`, `RunningDataSchema`, `StrengthDataSchema`, `CyclingDataSchema`, `SkiingDataSchema`, `GeneralActivityDataSchema`
- Implemented `ActivityDataSchema` as discriminated union with graceful validation
- Added validation for activity-specific metrics with appropriate constraints (e.g., positive numbers for distances/weights)
- Updated `FitnessProfileSchema` to include the new `activityData` field
- Exported TypeScript types for all activity schemas
- All schemas include proper fallbacks and optional fields for robustness

### 3. Enhanced Gap Detection Logic (✅ Completed)
**Location**: `src/server/agents/onboardingChat/prompts.ts`
**Changes**:
- Completely implemented `computeContextualGaps()` function with activity-specific intelligence
- Added detailed gap detection for each activity type:
  - **Hiking**: experience level, distance experience, elevation comfort, pack experience, equipment
  - **Running**: experience level, weekly volume, distance experience, pace baseline, race experience
  - **Strength**: experience level, training frequency, current lifts, equipment access
  - **Cycling**: experience level, training volume, distance experience, terrain comfort
  - **Skiing**: experience level, seasonal experience, terrain comfort, equipment ownership
  - **Custom Activities**: activity name, experience level, specific metrics

- Added universal gap detection that applies regardless of activity:
  - Timeline gaps, event preparation gaps, equipment details, schedule preferences
  - Constraint modifications, physical baseline, current training context

- Maintains backward compatibility with existing profiles that don't have activityData

### 4. Profile Agent Enhancement (✅ Already Enhanced)
**Location**: `src/server/agents/profile/prompts.ts`
**Status**: The profile agent prompts were already enhanced with activity-specific data extraction
**Existing Features**:
- Activity detection logic already implemented in system prompts
- Examples provided for hiking, running, strength, cycling, skiing, and custom activities
- Instructions for populating `activityData` field with structured information
- Activity-specific experience, metrics, equipment, and goals extraction

## Technical Implementation Details

### Type Safety Approach ✅
- Used TypeScript discriminated unions for type-safe pattern matching
- All ActivityData types have a `type` field for discrimination
- Proper typing throughout with no `any` types in final implementation
- Zod schemas provide runtime validation with TypeScript type inference

### Backward Compatibility ✅
- All changes are additive (no breaking changes)
- Existing profiles without `activityData` continue to work unchanged
- Legacy gap detection logic remains as fallback
- Optional fields throughout ensure graceful degradation

### Data Storage Strategy ✅
- Leverages existing JSONB storage in PostgreSQL
- No database migrations required
- Structured data with flexible schema
- Easy to query and index as needed

## Validation Results ✅

### Code Quality Checks
- **Lint**: ✅ Passes (`pnpm lint` - no ESLint errors)
- **TypeScript**: ✅ Passes (`pnpm tsc --noEmit` - no type errors)
- **Type Safety**: ✅ All imports and type references resolved correctly

### Architecture Compliance
- ✅ Follows existing patterns and conventions
- ✅ Uses established Zod schema structure
- ✅ Maintains clean separation of concerns
- ✅ No circular dependencies introduced

## Key Benefits Delivered

1. **Zero-Risk Implementation**: No database changes, no breaking changes
2. **Type-Safe Activity Intelligence**: Discriminated unions enable robust pattern matching
3. **Scalable Architecture**: New activities can be added without schema changes
4. **Intelligent Gap Detection**: Activity-specific questions based on structured data
5. **Enhanced Conversation Context**: Rich profile data for relevant conversations

## Next Steps (Future Phases)

### Phase 2: Smart Conversations
- Activity-specific question templates
- Enhanced contextual response generation
- Cross-activity intelligence

### Phase 3: Profile Agent Integration  
- Enhanced activity detection in profile extraction
- Cross-activity fitness inference
- Progressive profile building workflows

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement
- Core activity testing scenarios
- Edge case handling
- Validation and safety measures

## Files Modified

1. `src/server/models/user/index.ts` - Added ActivityData types and FitnessProfile.activityData field
2. `src/server/models/user/schemas.ts` - Added Zod validation schemas for all activity types  
3. `src/server/agents/onboardingChat/prompts.ts` - Implemented computeContextualGaps() with activity-specific logic

## Risk Assessment: ✅ LOW RISK

- No database schema changes
- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing functionality preserved
- Type safety maintained throughout
- Lint and build checks passing
