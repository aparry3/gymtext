# Production Readiness Plan - GymText

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Pre-Production
**Target Launch**: TBD

## Executive Summary

GymText has a solid technical foundation with clean architecture, type safety, and modern tooling. However, several critical gaps must be addressed before production launch. This document outlines the requirements for production readiness across testing, monitoring, security, reliability, and operational excellence.

### Current State
- âœ… Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
- âœ… Type-safe codebase with TypeScript
- âœ… Database migrations using Kysely
- âœ… Async job processing via Inngest with retries
- âœ… Basic error handling and circuit breaker pattern
- ðŸ”´ **Zero automated tests** (infrastructure exists, no test files)
- ðŸ”´ **No monitoring or alerting** (only console.log statements)
- ðŸ”´ **Security gaps** (weak admin auth, no rate limiting, no input validation)
- ðŸŸ  **Limited reliability patterns** (no health checks, no graceful degradation)

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks
**Priority**: P0 - Block launch

---

### 2. Monitoring & Observability - CRITICAL ðŸ”´

**Current State**: 198 `console.log/error/warn` statements scattered throughout codebase. No structured logging or observability platform.

**Impact**: Blind to production issues, slow incident response, difficult debugging.

**Requirements**:

#### Structured Logging
- [ ] Replace console.log with structured logger (Winston, Pino, or similar)
- [ ] Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL
- [ ] Contextual logging with request IDs
- [ ] Log formatting for production (JSON)
- [ ] Log aggregation (CloudWatch, Datadog, Logtail)

**Example Structure**:
```typescript
logger.info('Message processed', {
  userId: user.id,
  messageId: message.id,
  duration: 123,
  provider: 'twilio',
  requestId: req.id
});
```

#### Error Tracking
- [ ] Implement Sentry or similar (Rollbar, Bugsnag)

- [ ] Release tracking
- [ ] Performance monitoring

**Critical Errors to Track**:

- [ ] SMS costs per user
- [ ] Revenue metrics (Stripe)

#### Distributed Tracing
- [ ] Trace requests across Inngest functions
- [ ] Trace external API calls
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks in message processing
- [ ] Track end-to-end latency

**Tools to Consider**:
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry (recommended), Rollbar
- **Logging**: Pino + Logtail, Winston + CloudWatch
- **APM**: Datadog, New Relic, Vercel Analytics
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana, Datadog

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks
**Priority**: P0 - Block launch

---

### 3. Alerting - CRITICAL ðŸ”´

**Current State**: No alerting infrastructure exists.

**Impact**: Production incidents go unnoticed, user-facing failures persist undetected.

**Requirements**:

#### Critical Alerts (Page On-Call)
- [ ] **Message delivery failure rate** > 10% over 5 minutes
- [ ] **Database connection failure**
- [ ] **LLM API failure rate** > 20% over 5 minutes

#### Warning Alerts (Slack/Email)
- [ ] **Message delivery failure rate** > 5% over 15 minutes
- [ ] **LLM API latency** p95 > 10 seconds
- [ ] **Database connection pool** > 80% utilization
- [ ] **Daily message cron** taking > 30 seconds
- [ ] **Failed payment attempts** > 5 per hour
- [ ] **Disk space** > 80% on database
- [ ] **Memory usage** > 85%
- [ ] **API rate limit** approaching (OpenAI, Google, Twilio)

#### Business Alerts
- [ ] **No messages sent** in past hour during business hours
- [ ] **No new signups** in past 24 hours
- [ ] **Subscription cancellation spike** (>10% increase)

### 4. Security - HIGH PRIORITY ðŸŸ 

**Current State**: Multiple security vulnerabilities identified.

**Impact**: Risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, abuse.

**Requirements**:

#### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] **Admin panel authentication**: Replace cookie-based auth with proper JWT or session
  - Current: Simple cookie `gt_admin: 'ok'` (middleware.ts:18-20)
  - Implement: Encrypted sessions with expiry
  - Add: Multi-factor authentication (optional but recommended)
- [ ] **API authentication**: Protect admin API routes
- [ ] **Session management**: Secure cookies with httpOnly, secure, sameSite
- [ ] **Password hashing**: If adding password auth (bcrypt, argon2)

#### Rate Limiting
- [ ] **SMS webhook** (`/api/twilio/sms`): 100 req/min per phone number
- [ ] **Admin API**: 1000 req/hour per session
- [ ] **Public API endpoints**: 60 req/min per IP
- [ ] **Cron endpoint**: Verify authorization header (already implemented)
- [ ] **LLM endpoints**: Prevent abuse of AI features

**Recommended**: Use Vercel Edge Config for rate limiting or upstash/redis

#### Input Validation
- [ ] Add Zod validation middleware for all API routes
- [ ] Validate phone numbers (E.164 format)
- [ ] Validate email addresses
- [ ] Sanitize user input before LLM prompts
- [ ] Validate webhook signatures

**Example**:
```typescript
const smsWebhookSchema = z.object({
  Body: z.string().max(1600),
  From: z.string().regex(/^\+[1-9]\d{1,14}$/),
  To: z.string().regex(/^\+[1-9]\d{1,14}$/),
});
```

#### Webhook Security
- [ ] **Twilio webhook verification**: Validate request signatures
  - Missing in `/api/twilio/sms/route.ts`
  - Use `twilio.validateRequest()`
- [ ] **Stripe webhook verification**: Ensure signature verification is enforced
  - Check if implemented in Stripe webhook handler
- [ ] **Replay attack prevention**: Track processed webhook IDs

#### Security Headers
- [ ] Add security headers (Helmet.js or Next.js config)
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
  - X-XSS-Protection
- [ ] CORS configuration (restrict allowed origins)

#### Secrets Management
- [ ] Validate all required environment variables on startup
- [ ] Consider AWS Secrets Manager or Vercel env encryption for production
- [ ] Rotate API keys regularly
- [ ] Never log secrets or tokens
- [ ] Add secret scanning in CI/CD (GitHub secret scanning)

#### Data Protection
- [ ] Encrypt PII at rest (phone numbers, emails)
- [ ] Use HTTPS everywhere (already on Vercel)
- [ ] Implement data retention policies
- [ ] Add audit logging for sensitive operations
- [ ] GDPR compliance (data export, deletion)

#### SQL Injection Protection
- [ ] Ensure all Kysely queries use parameterized queries (already the case)
- [ ] Review raw SQL usage in migrations
- [ ] Add SQL injection testing

**Security Checklist**:
- [ ] Run security audit: `pnpm audit`
- [ ] Add Dependabot for dependency updates
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy
- [ ] Add CSRF protection for forms
- [ ] Review and minimize CORS allowed origins
- [ ] Implement request size limits
- [ ] Add brute force protection for auth

**Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks
**Priority**: P1 - Must have for launch

// /api/readiness
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "checks": {
    "database": "ok",
    "redis": "ok",
    "inngest": "ok"
  },

- [ ] If Pinecone fails, skip context retrieval

#### Error Recovery
- [ ] Implement dead letter queue for failed Inngest jobs
- [ ] Manual retry mechanism for failed messages
- [ ] Cleanup jobs for stuck processes
- [ ] Orphan record detection

#### Request Timeouts
- [ ] API route timeouts (already set for cron: 60s, 300s)

### APM & Metrics
- **Vercel Analytics** (Built-in): Basic performance monitoring
- **Datadog** (Recommended for growth): Full-stack observability
- **Alternatives**: New Relic, Grafana Cloud

### Alerting
- **PagerDuty** (Recommended): On-call management
- **Alternatives**: Opsgenie, VictorOps, built-in Sentry alerts

### Security
- **Vercel Edge Config**: Rate limiting
- **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **GitHub Advanced Security**: Secret scanning, code scanning

### Testing
- **Vitest** (Already configured): Fast unit/integration testing
- **Playwright**: E2E testing
- **k6**: Load testing

### CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions** (Recommended): Native integration
- **Alternatives**: GitLab CI, CircleCI

## Resource Requirements

### Engineering Effort
- **Phase 1**: 1 senior engineer full-time (3 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: 1 senior engineer + 1 QA engineer (1 week)
- **Phase 3**: 1 engineer part-time (ongoing)

### Budget Estimate
- **Error Tracking (Sentry)**: $26-100/month
- **Logging (Logtail)**: $29-99/month
- **APM (Datadog)**: $15-31/host/month
- **Alerting (PagerDuty)**: $21-41/user/month
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**: Included with GitHub
- **Load Testing (k6 Cloud)**: $49-299/month
- **Total Estimated**: $150-600/month (depending on scale)

### Infrastructure Scaling
- **Database**: Upgrade as user base grows (current: hobby tier)
- **Redis**: Add as caching becomes critical (current: optional)
- **Vercel**: Scale to Pro tier for production ($20/user/month)
