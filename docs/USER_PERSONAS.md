# GymText User Personas

This document defines 15 realistic user personas representing the diversity of GymText users. Each persona grounds our training examples in real people with authentic constraints, goals, and contexts.

**Purpose:** These personas drive all example creation. Rather than building abstract "beginner programs" or "advanced routines," we create training plans for **Sarah** (busy professional) or **Chen** (powerlifting competitor). This ensures examples feel real and useful.

## Using These Personas

When creating training examples:

1. **Choose a persona** that matches the example's target audience
2. **Use their name** in the example (makes it feel real)
3. **Respect their constraints** (equipment, time, experience)
4. **Address their context** (busy professional, parent, athlete, traveler)
5. **Match their goals** (don't give bodybuilding programming to a powerlifter)

**Example:**
Instead of "Intermediate Upper/Lower Split," write "Marcus's Upper/Lower Split - Breaking Through the Intermediate Plateau." The programming becomes specific, contextual, and useful for someone in Marcus's exact situation.

These personas ensure every example we create feels real, useful, and grounded in actual human needs.
