# Database Comparison: MongoDB vs PostgreSQL for Workout Plans

## Current Context
GymText currently uses PostgreSQL with Kysely ORM for all data storage. The workout planning system requires storing complex, hierarchical data structures including programs, phases, weeks, sessions, and exercises.

## MongoDB Analysis

### Benefits
1. **Natural Fit for Hierarchical Data**
   - Workout plans are inherently nested (program → phases → weeks → sessions → exercises)
   - Store entire program as a single document
   - No complex joins needed for retrieval

2. **Flexible Schema**
   - Easy to add new exercise types or program variations
   - Adaptations and modifications can be stored without schema changes
   - Different program types can have different structures

3. **Performance for Read-Heavy Operations**
   - Retrieve entire program in one query
   - Embedded documents reduce query complexity
   - Better performance for "get today's workout" queries

4. **Simpler Data Modeling**
   ```javascript
   {
     _id: "program-123",
     userId: "user-456",
     name: "12-Week Strength Program",
     phases: [
       {
         name: "Foundation",
         weeks: [
           {
             sessions: [
               {
                 exercises: [...]
               }
             ]
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Costs
1. **Operational Complexity**
   - Introduce a second database system
   - Additional infrastructure to manage
   - Different backup/restore procedures
   - Separate monitoring and alerting

2. **Data Consistency Challenges**
   - No foreign key constraints
   - Must maintain referential integrity in application code
   - Potential for orphaned data
   - Complex transactions across collections

3. **Team Learning Curve**
   - New query language to learn
   - Different optimization strategies
   - MongoDB-specific patterns and anti-patterns

4. **Integration Costs**
   - Need new ORM/ODM (like Mongoose)
   - Rewrite data access layer
   - Update TypeScript type generation
   - Modify existing Kysely migrations

## PostgreSQL with JSONB Analysis

### Benefits
1. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**
   - Already in use, team familiar with it
   - Existing backup, monitoring, deployment processes
   - Kysely ORM already configured
   - TypeScript types auto-generated

2. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Structured data in tables (users, subscriptions)
   - Semi-structured data in JSONB columns
   - Best of both relational and document models
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE workout_programs (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
     name VARCHAR(255),
     program_data JSONB -- stores phases, weeks, sessions
   );
   ```

3. **Strong Consistency**
   - ACID transactions
   - Foreign key constraints for data integrity
   - Can enforce relationships between programs and users
   - Rollback capabilities

4. **Powerful Query Capabilities**
   - SQL for complex analytics
   - JSONB operators for document queries
   - Can index inside JSON structures
   - Window functions for progress tracking

5. **Single Source of Truth**
   - All data in one database
   - Consistent backup/restore
   - Unified monitoring
   - Simpler disaster recovery

### Costs
1. **More Complex Queries**
   - Need joins for fully normalized data
   - JSONB queries can be verbose
   - Performance implications for deep nesting

2. **Schema Management**
   - More tables and relationships to manage
   - Migration complexity for schema changes
   - Balancing normalization vs denormalization

## Recommendation: PostgreSQL with Hybrid Approach

### Rationale
1. **Minimize Operational Overhead**: Adding MongoDB increases complexity without proportional benefits
2. **Leverage Existing Investment**: Team knowledge, infrastructure, and tooling already in place
3. **Maintain Data Integrity**: PostgreSQL's constraints prevent data inconsistencies
4. **Future Flexibility**: Can always migrate specific use cases to MongoDB later if needed

### Recommended Architecture

```sql
-- Core relational structure for integrity and querying
CREATE TABLE workout_programs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    name VARCHAR(255),
    program_type VARCHAR(50),
    status VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE program_phases (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    program_id UUID REFERENCES workout_programs(id),
    phase_number INTEGER,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    phase_data JSONB -- flexible phase-specific data
);

-- Store complex nested data as JSONB
CREATE TABLE program_weeks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    phase_id UUID REFERENCES program_phases(id),
    week_number INTEGER,
    week_template JSONB -- stores sessions, exercises, adaptations
);

-- Materialized view for performance
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW user_current_workouts AS
SELECT 
    u.id as user_id,
    wp.id as program_id,
    pw.week_template->>'sessions' as today_sessions
FROM users u
JOIN workout_programs wp ON u.id = wp.user_id
JOIN program_weeks pw ON ...
```

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Use JSONB for Variable Structure**
   - Exercise variations and modifications
   - User-specific adaptations
   - Program templates
   - Progress tracking data

2. **Use Tables for Queryable Data**
   - User-program relationships
   - Workout completion status
   - Analytics and reporting
   - Subscription management

3. **Optimize with Indexes**
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_program_data ON workout_programs USING gin(program_data);
   CREATE INDEX idx_user_programs ON workout_programs(user_id, status);
   ```

4. **Consider Future Caching**
   - Redis for frequently accessed programs
   - Materialized views for complex queries
   - Application-level caching for workout generation

## Migration Path

If MongoDB becomes necessary later:
1. Start with specific use cases (e.g., exercise library)
2. Run both databases in parallel initially
3. Gradually migrate data based on access patterns
4. Use change data capture for synchronization

## Conclusion

PostgreSQL with JSONB provides the best balance of:
- Operational simplicity
- Data integrity
- Query flexibility
- Team productivity
- Cost effectiveness

The hybrid approach allows storing complex workout structures while maintaining the benefits of a relational database. This decision can be revisited as the system scales and requirements evolve.

## Reconsidering with Equal Expertise and Easy Migration

If the team is equally comfortable with both databases and migration is not a concern, the decision shifts to pure technical merit for the use case.

### MongoDB Becomes More Attractive When:

1. **Workout Plans as Self-Contained Documents**
   - Each program is truly independent
   - Minimal cross-references between programs
   - Read entire program >> update individual parts
   - Natural fit: retrieve user's program → send workout

2. **Rapid Iteration on Program Structure**
   - Frequent changes to program formats
   - A/B testing different program structures
   - Supporting many program "types" with different schemas
   - Third-party program imports with varying formats

3. **Scale Patterns**
   - Millions of programs with simple access patterns
   - Sharding by user_id is straightforward
   - Read-heavy workload (generate daily workouts)
   - Programs are "write once, read many"

### PostgreSQL Remains Better When:

1. **Complex Cross-Entity Queries**
   - "Show all users on Week 3 of any strength program"
   - "Find programs with >80% completion rate"
   - Analytics across programs and users
   - Aggregate progress tracking

2. **Transactional Requirements**
   - Ensuring payment + program assignment atomicity
   - Maintaining consistency across related entities
   - Complex business rules with multiple entities

3. **Relational Integrity**
   - Programs reference shared exercise library
   - User feedback affects program recommendations
   - Coaches managing multiple client programs
   - Equipment availability affects multiple programs

### My Revised Recommendation

**Still PostgreSQL, but for different reasons:**

1. **Your SMS + AI Architecture**: Your agent system needs to query across multiple data points (user profile, past workouts, current program, equipment) to generate appropriate workouts. PostgreSQL's joins make this natural.

2. **Future Features**: The PRD mentions coach interfaces, progress analytics, and program sharing - all inherently relational features that would require complex aggregation pipelines in MongoDB.

3. **Workout Logs ↔ Programs**: You need bidirectional queries between completed workouts and program templates for adaptation. This is painful in MongoDB.

**However, consider MongoDB for specific bounded contexts:**
- **Exercise Library**: Could live in MongoDB as a separate service
- **Program Templates Marketplace**: If you build a template sharing system
- **Historical Workout Archive**: After 6 months, move to MongoDB for cost-effective storage

### The Architectural Middle Ground

```
PostgreSQL (Source of Truth)
├── Users, Subscriptions, Payments
├── Active Programs & Assignments  
├── Workout Logs & Feedback
└── Analytics & Reporting

MongoDB (Specialized Storage)
├── Exercise Library & Videos
├── Program Template Repository
└── Archived Workout History

Redis (Performance Layer)
├── Current Week's Workouts
├── User Preferences Cache
└── Active Program Cache
```

This gives you the best of both worlds without the complexity of trying to maintain consistency between two databases for core business data.
