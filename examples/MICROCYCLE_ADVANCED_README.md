# Microcycle Examples: Advanced Powerlifting Peaking (Weeks 2, 6, 10)

Detailed microcycle examples showing 4-block linear periodization toward competition peak for advanced powerlifting programming.

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate:
- **How `microcycle:generate` should structure advanced sport-specific programming**
- **Competition-focused periodization** (peaking toward specific meet date)
- **Wave loading patterns** (Week 5: 80%, Week 6: 82.5%, Week 7: 85%, Week 8: deload)
- **Progressive intensity increases** across blocks (accumulation → strength → peaking)
- **RPE-based auto-regulation guidance** integrated into daily descriptions
- **Competition lift practice** (squat/bench/deadlift 2-3x per week with varying intensities)

## Week Selection Rationale

**Week 2 — Mid-Accumulation (Block 1):**
- Represents typical accumulation programming (4-5 sets × 5-8 reps @ RPE 7-8)
- Shows secondary variations (pause squats, close-grip bench, deficit deadlifts)
- Demonstrates higher volume (4-5 sets per lift) vs later blocks
- Accessories target weak points (3-4 sets × 8-12 reps)

**Week 6 — Mid-Strength Building (Block 2, Wave Loading Week 2):**
- Demonstrates wave loading: 82.5% 4×3 @ RPE 8-9 (between Week 5's 80% and Week 7's 85%)
- Shows reduced volume (4 sets × 3 reps vs accumulation's 5 sets × 5-8 reps)
- Accessories reduced to 3 sets × 6-8 reps (from 3-4 sets × 8-12 reps)
- Emphasizes bar speed monitoring as fatigue management tool

**Week 10 — Mid-Peaking (Block 3, Heavy Doubles):**
- Demonstrates near-maximal loads: 92.5% 3×2 @ RPE 9.5
- Shows minimal volume (3 sets × 2 reps, some lifters do 3×1)
- Accessories eliminated or reduced to 2 sets × 8-10 reps (maintenance only)
- Emphasizes perfect technique, confidence building, CNS preparation

## Plan Context

These microcycles derive from the **Advanced Powerlifting Peaking** plan:
- **Duration:** 12 weeks ending with competition day
- **Split:** Upper/Lower (4 days/week)
- **Frequency:** Competition lifts practiced 2-3x/week (primary + secondary days)
- **Goal:** Peak squat, bench press, deadlift for powerlifting meet

### 4-Block Periodization

| Block | Weeks | Sets × Reps | Intensity (% 1RM) | RPE | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------------|-----|-------|
| **Accumulation** | 1-4 | 4-5 × 5-8 | 70-75% | 7-8 | Work capacity, technique, hypertrophy |
| **Strength Building** | 5-8 | 3-4 × 3-5 | 75-85% | 8-9 | Wave loading (80% → 82.5% → 85% → deload) |
| **Peaking** | 9-11 | 2-3 × 1-3 | 90-97.5% | 9-10 | Heavy triples → doubles → singles |
| **Taper** | 12 | Minimal | Openers | N/A | Fatigue dissipation, competition prep |

## Key Programming Features

### Upper/Lower Split Structure

**Lower Days (Mon/Thu):**
- Monday: Squat emphasis (primary squat day, heaviest volume)
- Thursday: Deadlift emphasis (primary deadlift day, secondary squat work at lighter %)

**Upper Days (Tue/Sat):**
- Tuesday: Bench emphasis (primary bench day, heaviest pressing)
- Saturday: Volume bench + accessories (secondary bench day, 70-80% of Tuesday's load)

**Rest Days (Wed/Fri/Sun):**
- Wednesday: Between heavy squat and heavy bench
- Friday: After heavy deadlift day
- Sunday: Complete weekly rest

### RPE-Based Auto-Regulation

**Integrated into every main lift prescription:**
- Week 2 (Accumulation): "If Week 1's RPE 7-8 felt like RPE 7, add 5-10lbs; if it felt like RPE 8.5, hold weight and focus on bar speed"
- Week 6 (Strength): "If third rep is a grind (>3sec), reduce weight by 5-10lbs next set"
- Week 10 (Peaking): "If second rep stalls or takes >5sec, weight is too heavy—competition is more important than hitting prescribed percentages"

**Bar speed as fatigue indicator:**
- Accumulation: "Bar speed should be fast/moderate"
- Strength: "If bar speed slows significantly, stop set (RPE 7-8, not 9)"
- Peaking: "First rep moves with decent speed; second rep will slow but should complete without stalling"

### Volume/Intensity Inverse Relationship

| Week | Phase | Squat Volume | Squat Intensity | Total Reps |
|------|-------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| Week 2 | Accumulation | 5×5 | 70-75% (~RPE 7-8) | 25 reps |
| Week 6 | Strength | 4×3 | 82.5% (~RPE 8-9) | 12 reps |
| Week 10 | Peaking | 3×2 | 92.5% (~RPE 9.5) | 6 reps |

As intensity increases toward competition, volume decreases to manage fatigue and maintain technique quality.

### Accessory Progression

| Week | Phase | Accessory Volume | Accessory Sets × Reps | Purpose |
|------|-------|------------------|-----------------------|---------|
| Week 2 | Accumulation | High | 3-4 sets × 8-12 reps | Hypertrophy, weak point targeting |
| Week 6 | Strength | Moderate | 3 sets × 6-8 reps | Strength support, reduced to preserve energy |
| Week 10 | Peaking | Minimal | 2 sets × 8-10 reps or eliminated | Maintenance only, injury prevention |

### Secondary Variations Strategy

**Week 2 (Accumulation):**
- Pause squats (2sec pause at parallel): Addresses weakness out of the hole
- Close-grip bench: Lockout/triceps strength
- Deficit deadlifts (1-2" platform): Off-the-floor strength

**Week 6 (Strength):**
- Variations reduced or eliminated
- Focus shifts to competition lifts
- Only keep variations that directly support main lifts

**Week 10 (Peaking):**
- NO variations
- Competition lifts exclusively
- Accessories only for injury prevention (face pulls, light RDLs)

### Conditioning Strategy

**Week 2 (Accumulation):**
- Optional 2x/week 15-20min Zone 2 cardio (bike, walk) on off-days or post-lift
- Keeps conditioning baseline without interfering with recovery

**Week 6 (Strength):**
- Reduce to 1x/week 15min if desired
- Priority shifts to lifting recovery

**Week 10 (Peaking):**
- NO conditioning
- All energy reserved for near-maximal lifts and competition prep

## Day-by-Day Structure

Each microcycle includes 7 detailed day descriptions:

### Training Days (Mon/Tue/Thu/Sat)

**Structure:**
1. Warm-up (10-20min, longer as intensity increases)
2. Main lift (competition squat/bench/deadlift with prescribed sets × reps @ RPE)
3. Secondary lift (variation or lighter competition lift)
4. Accessories (3-4 exercises, volume decreases across blocks)
5. Cooldown (5-10min stretching + foam rolling)

**Key elements:**
- Detailed warm-up protocols (dynamic stretching, bar work, warm-up sets)
- Setup cues for each main lift (foot position, grip, bracing, bar path)
- Execution guidance (tempo, depth, lockout, safety)
- Rest period prescriptions (3-5min main lifts, 2-3min secondaries, 90sec accessories)
- Recording instructions (weight, reps, RPE, bar speed, form notes)
- Safety warnings (when to stop set, when to reduce weight)
- Session duration estimates (65-90min depending on phase)

### Rest Days (Wed/Fri/Sun)

**Structure:**
1. Rest importance explanation (CNS/joint recovery needs)
2. Optional activities (10-15min easy walk, gentle stretching, mobility work)
3. Recovery priorities (sleep, nutrition, hydration, stress management)
4. Reflection prompts (how did previous session feel? form issues? RPE accuracy?)
5. Planning guidance (adjust next session's loads based on RPE/bar speed)

**Purpose:**
- Educates on importance of rest during heavy training
- Provides specific recovery strategies
- Encourages self-assessment and load adjustment
- Prevents overtraining through active reflection

## Comparison: Beginner vs Intermediate vs Advanced

### High-Level Differences

| Aspect | Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced |
|--------|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Frequency** | 3 days/week (full body) | 6 days/week (PPL) | 4 days/week (upper/lower) |
| **Split** | Full body (same patterns 3x/week) | Push/Pull/Legs (each muscle 2x/week) | Upper/Lower (comp lifts 2-3x/week) |
| **Periodization** | Linear progression | Block (accumulation → intensification) | Linear toward peak (4 blocks → competition) |
| **Rep ranges** | 12-15 reps (skill acquisition) | 6-20 reps (hypertrophy spectrum) | 1-8 reps (strength/power, peaking to singles) |
| **Intensity** | RPE 5-6 → 6-7 (conservative) | RPE 7-8 → 8-9 (closer to failure) | RPE 7-8 → 9-10 (competition singles) |
| **Goal** | Build training foundation | Build muscle (hypertrophy) | Win powerlifting meet (peak Big 3) |
| **Endpoint** | Ongoing training | Assessment (no competition) | Competition day (specific date) |

### Microcycle Detail Complexity

**Beginner Week 1:**
- Focus: "Learning movement patterns, building base"
- Guidance: "2-3 sets, RPE 5-6, if form breaks down reduce weight"
- Accessories: Generic (goblet squat, DB RDL, DB bench press)
- Rest: "60-90s between exercises"

**Intermediate Week 1:**
- Focus: "Accumulation phase launch, PPL split introduction, 12-14 sets per muscle"
- Guidance: "RPE 7-8 (~70-75% 1RM), track all lifts, add 5-10lbs if Week 1 felt easy"
- Accessories: Specific (pull-ups vs lat pulldown, barbell row vs chest-supported row)
- Rest: "90-120sec compounds, 60-90sec accessories/isolation"

**Advanced Week 2:**
- Focus: "Build work capacity with 4-5 sets × 5-8 reps @ RPE 7-8, secondary variations, hypertrophy accessories"
- Guidance: "If Week 1's RPE 7-8 felt like RPE 7, add 5-10lbs; if RPE 8.5, hold weight and focus on bar speed. Record: weight, actual reps, RPE per set"
- Accessories: Weak-point specific (pause squats if weak out of hole, close-grip bench if lockout weak)
- Rest: "3min compounds (full recovery for quality reps), 2-3min secondaries, 90-120sec accessories"

**Key differences:**
- Beginner: Educational (teaches what RPE is, what soreness means)
- Intermediate: Prescriptive (specific volume/intensity targets, tracking introduced)
- Advanced: Diagnostic (self-assess bar speed, adjust loads based on RPE accuracy, address weak points)

### Warm-Up Complexity

**Beginner Week 1 Monday:**
```
Warm-up: 5-10min light cardio, dynamic stretches (leg swings, arm circles), 
bodyweight movement practice (squats, push-ups)
```

**Intermediate Week 1 Monday:**
```
Warm-up: 5-10min light cardio, dynamic stretches (arm circles, band pull-aparts, 
scapular push-ups), movement-specific warm-up (empty bar bench × 10)
```

**Advanced Week 2 Monday:**
```
Warm-up: 10min (5min bike/row for light sweat, dynamic stretches: leg swings, 
hip circles, ankle mobility, bar work: empty bar squats, 3rd-world squats, 
goblet squats). Warm-up sets: Bar × 10, 135lbs × 5, 185lbs × 3, 225lbs × 2, 
275lbs × 1, then working weight (gradual load increase, perfect form, 
build confidence).
```

**Key differences:**
- Beginner: Generic (light cardio + stretches)
- Intermediate: Movement-specific (activation work for session's focus)
- Advanced: Detailed progression (specific warm-up sets with weights, deliberate load increases, confidence building)

### Rest Day Guidance

**Beginner Week 1 Tuesday:**
```
Rest day. Expect mild soreness—this is normal. If something hurts (sharp pain, 
joint discomfort), rest more. Optional: light walk, stretching.
```

**Intermediate Week 1 Sunday:**
```
Rest or optional Zone 2 cardio (20-30min easy). Prioritize sleep, nutrition 
(~1g/lb protein), hydration. Reflect: How did 6-day split feel? Any exercises 
awkward? Note observations for Week 2.
```

**Advanced Week 2 Wednesday:**
```
Complete rest after two heavy days. CNS and joints need recovery—Monday's squats 
and Tuesday's pressing are neurally demanding. Options: (A) 15-20min Zone 2 cardio 
(restorative, not taxing), (B) 10-15min gentle mobility (hips, shoulders, ankles), 
(C) Complete rest. Do NOT lift. Prioritize: Sleep 7-8 hours (consistent bed/wake), 
nutrition (hit protein target ~1g/lb, slight surplus), hydration, stress management. 
Reflect: Compare Monday's squats to Week 1—how did they feel? Form breakdown? 
Use Thursday's session to address issues.
```

**Key differences:**
- Beginner: Permission to rest (education that rest is okay)
- Intermediate: Structured reflection (assess week, plan ahead)
- Advanced: Detailed recovery protocols (specific strategies, reflection prompts for load adjustment, CNS recovery emphasis)

- ✅ 4-block periodization captured (accumulation → strength → peaking → taper)
- ✅ Wave loading in strength block (specific percentages Week 5-7)
- ✅ Inverse volume/intensity relationship (5×5 → 4×3 → 3×2 as intensity rises)
- ✅ RPE-based auto-regulation guidance (bar speed monitoring, load adjustment)
- ✅ Upper/Lower split structure (Mon: Squat, Tue: Bench, Thu: Deadlift, Sat: Volume Bench)
- ✅ Secondary variations strategy (pause/close-grip/deficit in accumulation, eliminated in peaking)
- ✅ Accessory progression (3-4 sets × 8-12 → 3 sets × 6-8 → 2 sets × 8-10 or eliminated)
- ✅ Conditioning periodization (2x → 1x → 0x as peaking progresses)
- ✅ Competition-day orientation (Week 10 description references Week 12 taper and competition Sunday)

### 3. UI Development

- 4-block periodization visualization (color-code accumulation/strength/peaking/taper)
- Wave loading chart (Week 5: 80%, Week 6: 82.5%, Week 7: 85%, Week 8: deload)
- RPE tracking with auto-regulation alerts (if logged RPE deviates from prescribed, suggest load adjustment)
- Competition countdown (X weeks until meet date)
- Bar speed tracking (fast/moderate/slow per rep)
- Form breakdown logging (did hips shoot up? back round? bar drift?)

### 4. Database Seeding
- Seed advanced microcycle templates with competition-specific programming
- Populate example wave loading patterns
- Provide realistic powerlifting peaking examples for UI demonstrations

## Quality Standards

These advanced microcycles meet all standards:

### ✅ Sport-Specific Programming
- Competition endpoint (12-week cycle ends with powerlifting meet)
- Specific competition lifts (squat, bench press, deadlift practiced 2-3x/week)
- Peaking strategy (accumulation → strength → peaking → taper)
- Competition-day protocols referenced (Week 12 taper: openers Wednesday, compete Sunday)

### ✅ Wave Loading Demonstrated
- Week 5: 80% 4×4 @ RPE 8-9
- **Week 6: 82.5% 4×3 @ RPE 8-9** (this example)
- Week 7: 85% 3×3 @ RPE 9
- Week 8: Deload at 70-75% of Week 7

### ✅ RPE-Based Auto-Regulation
- Every main lift includes RPE target
- Specific load adjustment protocols (±5-10lbs based on RPE accuracy)
- Bar speed as fatigue indicator (if rep >3-5sec, reduce load)
- Safety triggers (when to stop set, when to skip second rep)

### ✅ Inverse Volume/Intensity Relationship
- Week 2 (Accumulation): 5×5 @ 70-75%
- Week 6 (Strength): 4×3 @ 82.5%
- Week 10 (Peaking): 3×2 @ 92.5%
- Total reps decrease (25 → 12 → 6) as intensity increases

### ✅ Accessory Adaptation
- Week 2: 3-4 sets × 8-12 reps (hypertrophy focus)
- Week 6: 3 sets × 6-8 reps (strength support, reduced volume)
- Week 10: 2 sets × 8-10 reps or eliminated (maintenance only)

### ✅ Advanced Detail Level
- Detailed warm-up protocols (specific weights, deliberate progression)
- Setup cues for every main lift (foot position, grip, bracing, bar path)
- Execution guidance (tempo, depth, lockout, common mistakes)
- Recording instructions (weight, reps, RPE, bar speed, form notes)
- Reflection prompts for load adjustment
- Safety warnings integrated throughout

## Design Decisions

**Why Weeks 2, 6, 10 instead of 1, 5, 9?**
- Week 2: Mid-accumulation (established baseline, not overwhelming like Week 1)
- Week 6: Mid-wave loading (demonstrates 82.5% between 80% and 85%)
- Week 10: Mid-peaking (heavy doubles, not as extreme as Week 11's singles)
- These represent typical programming within each block (not outliers)

**Why Upper/Lower split instead of Full Body or PPL?**
- Competition lifts (squat/bench/deadlift) require 2-3x frequency for skill retention and strength
- Upper/Lower allows this frequency while managing fatigue (heavy squat Mon, heavy deadlift Thu)
- 4 days/week allows 3 rest days (CNS recovery critical for 80-97.5% loads)

**Why inverse volume/intensity relationship?**
- Higher intensity requires lower volume to maintain technique quality
- Fatigue accumulation at 90%+ is exponential (3×2 @ 92.5% more fatiguing than 5×5 @ 70%)
- Competition prep prioritizes peak performance, not accumulated volume

**Why eliminate conditioning during peaking?**
- Conditioning creates interference effect (competes for recovery resources)
- All energy reserved for near-maximal lifts (92.5-97.5% in Weeks 10-11)
- Cardiovascular fitness maintained from accumulation/strength blocks

**Why such detailed warm-ups?**
- Injury risk increases exponentially at 80%+ loads
- Thorough warm-up prepares CNS, joints, and technique
- Gradual load progression (Bar → 135 → 185 → 225 → 275 → working weight) builds confidence and readiness

**Why detailed rest day guidance?**
- Advanced lifters understand training stress better than beginners
- Detailed reflection prompts encourage self-assessment and auto-regulation
- Specific recovery strategies (sleep targets, nutrition timing, mobility protocols) optimize adaptation

## Extending This Pattern

For **Week 8 (Deload)**, expect:
- Scheduled deload at end of strength block (Week 8)
- Volume: 40% reduction from Week 7 (85% 3×3 → 70-75% 2×2 or 3×2)
- Intensity: 70-75% of Week 7 loads (moderate, not heavy)
- RPE: 6-7 (easy, no grinding)
- Purpose: Dissipate accumulated fatigue from 8 weeks of progressive loading, prepare for peaking block (Weeks 9-11)

For **Week 11 (Heavy Singles)**, expect:
- Peak of peaking block: 95-97.5% work up to top single @ RPE 9.5-10
- Volume: Minimal (work up to 1 heavy single per lift)
- Accessories: Eliminated entirely (only competition lifts + face pulls for shoulder health)
- Mental preparation: Visualize successful lifts, simulate competition environment
- Purpose: Test readiness, dial in openers for competition, build confidence

For **Week 12 (Taper/Competition)**, expect:
- Mon-Tue: Light technique work (70-80% for easy doubles/triples)
- Wednesday: Openers only (squat/bench/deadlift at opening attempt weights, confirm readiness)
- Thu-Sat: Complete rest (no lifting, no conditioning)
- Sunday: Competition day (weigh-in, warm-up, 3 attempts per lift, peak performance)
- Purpose: Fatigue dissipation, freshness for competition, confidence confirmation

For **Other Advanced Sport-Specific Plans**, expect similar structure:
- **Olympic Weightlifting:** Daily undulating periodization (DUP), snatch/clean & jerk variations, positional work, competition simulation
- **Bodybuilding:** Peak week (carb manipulation, water loading/cutting, posing practice), muscle-group specialization, pre-contest protocols
- **CrossFit Competition Prep:** Chipper workouts, metcon testing, skills refinement, concurrent training (strength + conditioning + skill)
