# Plan:Structured Example: Advanced Powerlifting Peaking

Structured (parsed) version of an Advanced Powerlifting Peaking program, demonstrating sport-specific periodization with competition as the endpoint. Shows significantly more complex programming than beginner/intermediate examples.

## Purpose

This example demonstrates:
- **How `plan:structured` agent should parse advanced sport-specific plans**
- **Sport-specific periodization** (powerlifting peaking cycle with competition timeline)
- **RPE-based auto-regulation** integrated into every main lift
- **Linear periodization toward peak** (accumulation → strength → peaking → taper)
- **Strategic volume/intensity manipulation** across 4 distinct blocks
- **Competition prep protocols** (taper week, opener practice, rest schedule)

## Comparison: Beginner vs Intermediate vs Advanced

### High-Level Differences

| Aspect | Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced |
|--------|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Name** | Beginner General Fitness Foundation | Intermediate Hypertrophy Focus | Advanced Powerlifting Peaking — 12-Week Competition Prep |
| **Type** | Full Body Stabilization | Push/Pull/Legs | Upper/Lower |
| **Duration** | 12 weeks | 16 weeks | 12 weeks |
| **Frequency** | 3 days/week | 6 days/week | 4 days/week |
| **Split** | Full body (same patterns 3x/week) | PPL (each muscle 2x/week) | Upper/Lower (competition lifts 2-3x/week) |
| **Periodization** | Linear progression | Block periodization (accumulation → intensification) | Linear periodization toward peak (4 blocks) |
| **Intensity** | RPE 5-6 → 6-7 (conservative) | RPE 7-8 → 8-9 (closer to failure) | RPE 7-8 → 9-10 (competition singles) |
| **Volume** | 2-3 sets x 12-15 reps | 3-4 sets x 6-20 reps (varies by lift) | 4-5 sets → 2-3 sets (decreases as intensity rises) |
| **Reps** | 12-15 reps (skill acquisition) | 6-20 reps (hypertrophy ranges) | 1-8 reps (strength/peaking ranges) |
| **Progression** | Simple (add weight at 3x15) | Complex (phase-specific volume/load rules) | Sport-specific (peak Big 3 for competition) |
| **Deloads** | Every 4th week or as needed | Scheduled (Weeks 7-8, 15-16) + auto-regulation | Scheduled (Week 8) + RPE-based auto-regulation on every lift |
| **Auto-Regulation** | Generic (if fatigued) | Triggers (3+ flat sessions, sleep issues) | RPE targets on every set (adjust load if ±1 point off) |
| **Conditioning** | Optional Zone 2, minimal | 2-3x/week structured (20-30min) | Weeks 1-4 only (2x/week), eliminated during peaking |
| **Endpoint** | Build training foundation | Build muscle (hypertrophy) | Win powerlifting meet (peak Big 3) |

### Key Differentiators: Advanced Plan

**1. Sport-Specific Goal**
- Beginner: General fitness, movement competency
- Intermediate: Hypertrophy (muscle growth)
- **Advanced: Competition performance (peak squat/bench/deadlift for specific meet date)**

**2. Auto-Regulation Sophistication**
- Beginner: Deload if fatigued (binary yes/no)
- Intermediate: Scheduled deloads + triggers (3+ flat sessions)
- **Advanced: RPE targets on every main lift with load adjustments (±5-10%) if RPE deviates ±1 point**

**3. Periodization Complexity**
- Beginner: Linear (add weight when hitting reps)
- Intermediate: Block (accumulation phase → intensification phase)
- **Advanced: Linear periodization toward peak with 4 distinct blocks (accumulation → strength building → peaking → taper) and wave loading**

**4. Volume/Intensity Relationship**
- Beginner: Volume stable (2-3 sets), intensity slowly increases
- Intermediate: Volume accumulates (12 → 20 sets), then intensity increases
- **Advanced: Inverse relationship (as intensity rises toward 95-97.5% 1RM, volume drops from 4-5 sets to 2-3 sets to singles)**

**5. Rep Ranges**
- Beginner: 12-15 reps (skill acquisition, low risk)
- Intermediate: 6-20 reps (hypertrophy spectrum)
- **Advanced: 1-8 reps (strength/power spectrum, peaking to competition singles)**

**6. Training Frequency Logic**
- Beginner: 3 days (manageable for novice recovery)
- Intermediate: 6 days (high frequency for muscle growth)
- **Advanced: 4 days (allows CNS/joint recovery from heavy compound lifts, 2-3x frequency on Big 3)**

**7. Accessory Work Strategy**
- Beginner: Accessories are primary (learning movements)
- Intermediate: Accessories drive volume for hypertrophy (3-4 sets x 10-15 reps)
- **Advanced: Accessories target weak points, volume decreases across blocks (3-4 sets → 2 sets → eliminated during taper)**

**8. Competition/Endpoint Specificity**
- Beginner: No endpoint (ongoing training)
- Intermediate: Assessment at end (photos, measurements, no competition)
- **Advanced: Competition day (Week 12 Sunday), taper protocol, opener practice, specific rest schedule Wed-Sat before meet**

### Core Strategy Complexity

**Beginner:**
```
3-day full-body training using NASM Stabilization Endurance Phase 
principles. Focus on movement quality, skill acquisition, and building 
sustainable training habits. Low intensity (50-60% 1RM), high reps 
(12-15), controlled tempo (3-1-1). Prioritize form mastery over 
progressive overload in early weeks.
```

**Intermediate:**
```
6-day Push/Pull/Legs split with volume accumulation for hypertrophy. 
High frequency per muscle group (2x/week) while managing fatigue 
through movement-pattern specificity. Uses block periodization: 
accumulation phase (increase volume) followed by intensification 
phase (increase load). Compound lifts (3-4 sets of 6-10 reps RPE 7-8), 
accessories (3-4 sets of 10-15 reps RPE 8-9), isolation (2-3 sets of 
12-20 reps RPE 9).
```

**Advanced:**
```
4-day upper/lower split designed to peak squat, bench press, and 
deadlift for competition. Combines high-frequency practice of 
competition lifts with strategic accessory work targeting weak points. 
Progressive overload through linear periodization: volume accumulation 
(Weeks 1-4) → strength building (Weeks 5-8) → peaking (Weeks 9-11) → 
taper (Week 12). Main lifts use RPE-based auto-regulation. Competition 
lifts performed 2-3x/week with varying intensities.
```

**Key differences:**
- Beginner: Focus on movement quality and habits
- Intermediate: Focus on hypertrophy through volume
- **Advanced: Focus on competition performance (peak Big 3 for specific meet date)**
- **Advanced: Mentions specific periodization timeline (4 blocks with week ranges)**
- **Advanced: Mentions RPE-based auto-regulation explicitly in core strategy**
- **Advanced: Competition lifts practiced 2-3x/week (frequency for skill retention + strength)**

### Progression Strategy Complexity

**Beginner (4 items):**
1. Weeks 1-4: Focus on form mastery
2. Weeks 5-8: Add 5-10lbs when hitting 3x15
3. Weeks 9-12: Continue load increases or add complexity
4. Skill Milestones (goblet squat → dumbbell → barbell)

**Intermediate (5 items):**
1. Phase 1 (Weeks 1-6): Accumulation — increase volume 12-14 → 18-20 sets
2. Phase 2 (Weeks 7-8): Deload — reduce volume by 50%
3. Phase 3 (Weeks 9-14): Intensification — increase load, maintain volume 14-16 sets
4. Phase 4 (Weeks 15-16): Final deload & assessment
5. Exercise variation: Rotate every 4-6 weeks

**Advanced (6 items):**
1. Block 1 — Accumulation (Weeks 1-4): 4-5 sets x 5-8 reps RPE 7-8, technique focus, secondary variations
2. Block 2 — Strength Building (Weeks 5-8): 3-4 sets x 3-5 reps RPE 8-9, wave loading (80% → 82.5% → 85%)
3. Block 3 — Peaking (Weeks 9-11): 2-3 sets x 1-3 reps RPE 9-10, heavy triples/doubles/singles (90% → 95-97.5%)
4. Block 4 — Taper (Week 12): 50-60% volume cut, openers Wednesday, complete rest Thu-Sat, competition Sunday
5. Auto-Regulation: RPE targets, adjust load ±5-10% if RPE deviates ±1 point
6. Accessory Progression: 3-4 sets x 8-12 reps (Weeks 1-4) → 3 sets x 6-8 reps (Weeks 5-8) → 2 sets x 8-10 reps or eliminated (Weeks 9-12)

**Key differences:**
- Beginner: Simple rules (add weight when hitting rep target)
- Intermediate: Block-based (accumulation vs intensification)
- **Advanced: Four distinct blocks with specific set/rep/RPE/intensity prescriptions per block**
- **Advanced: Wave loading in strength block (weekly intensity undulation: 80% → 82.5% → 85%)**
- **Advanced: Peaking block includes specific percentages (90%, 95-97.5%) plus RPE guidance**
- **Advanced: Taper block includes day-by-day protocol (openers Wed, rest Thu-Sat, compete Sun)**
- **Advanced: Auto-regulation as standalone item (not just deload protocol)**
- **Advanced: Accessory progression mapped across all blocks (volume/intensity reduces as peaking progresses)**

### Schedule Template Complexity

**Beginner (3 training days):**
- Monday: Full Body — Lower emphasis
- Wednesday: Full Body — Upper emphasis
- Friday: Full Body — Balanced
- Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday/Sunday: Rest

**Intermediate (6 training days):**
- Monday: Push — Chest & Shoulders
- Tuesday: Pull — Back & Biceps
- Wednesday: Legs — Quad emphasis
- Thursday: Push — Triceps & Front Delts
- Friday: Pull — Rear Delts & Biceps
- Saturday: Legs — Hamstring & Glute emphasis
- Sunday: Rest

**Advanced (4 training days):**
- Monday: Lower — Squat emphasis (primary squat day, heaviest volume, quad/glute accessories)
- Tuesday: Upper — Bench emphasis (primary bench day, heaviest pressing, lockout accessories)
- Wednesday: Rest or active recovery
- Thursday: Lower — Deadlift emphasis (primary deadlift day, secondary squat at lighter %, posterior chain)
- Friday: Rest or active recovery
- Saturday: Upper — Volume bench + accessory emphasis (secondary bench day, reduced intensity 70-80%, arm/back volume)
- Sunday: Rest

**Key differences:**
- Beginner: Same movement patterns 3x/week (full body)
- Intermediate: Each muscle group 2x/week via PPL split
- **Advanced: Competition lifts (squat/bench/deadlift) practiced 2-3x/week with primary + secondary days**
- **Advanced: Upper/Lower split allows recovery between heavy lower sessions (Mon → Thu is 3 days)**
- **Advanced: Primary days (Mon/Tue/Thu) = heaviest volume, Secondary days (Sat) = reduced intensity (70-80%)**
- **Advanced: Rationale mentions CNS recovery (e.g., "Friday rest allows CNS recovery from heavy pulls")**
- **Advanced: Accessory work explicitly mentioned in rationale (e.g., "lockout strength," "posterior chain")**

### Adjustment Strategy Complexity

**Beginner:**
```
Deload every 4th week OR if experiencing unusual fatigue/soreness. 
Reduce volume by 40-50% (drop to 2 sets per exercise), keep intensity 
moderate (stick with current weights, don't push for PRs), focus on 
movement quality and active recovery.
```

**Intermediate:**
```
Scheduled deloads at Weeks 7-8 and 15-16. Cut volume by 50-60%, 
maintain exercise selection, keep intensity moderate (70-80% of 
working weights). Focus on technique refinement and recovery. 
Auto-regulation deload if needed mid-block: If 3+ consecutive 
sessions feeling flat, sleep disruption, or joint pain occurs, take 
1 unscheduled deload week then resume.
```

**Advanced:**
```
Scheduled deload at Week 8 (end of strength block): reduce volume 40%, 
maintain intensity at 70-75% of Week 7 loads, focus on technique and 
recovery. Unscheduled deload protocol: If 2+ consecutive sessions hit 
RPE 1.5+ points above target, or if joint pain/sleep disruption occurs, 
insert immediate deload week (40% volume, 70% intensity) then resume 
block. Taper week is non-negotiable—respect the fatigue dissipation 
period. Competition day nutrition, sleep, and warm-up protocols detailed 
in Week 12 notes.
```

**Key differences:**
- Beginner: Generic timing (every 4th week)
- Intermediate: Specific timing aligned with periodization (Weeks 7-8, 15-16)
- **Advanced: Single scheduled deload at Week 8 (end of strength block before peaking begins)**
- **Advanced: Auto-regulation trigger is more precise (RPE 1.5+ points above target for 2+ sessions)**
- **Advanced: Taper (Week 12) is distinct from deload and non-negotiable (can't skip or move)**
- **Advanced: Mentions competition-day protocols (nutrition, sleep, warm-up) in Week 12 notes**
- **Advanced: Deload is strategic pause before peaking (not fatigue management during accumulation)**

### Conditioning Strategy

**Beginner:**
- Optional post-workout Zone 2 cardio (10-15min)
- Weekend active recovery (hiking, swimming)

**Intermediate:**
- Optional Zone 2 cardio: 2-3x/week, 20-30min
- Timing: Post-workout or off-days
- Purpose: Cardiovascular health, recovery enhancement, appetite regulation

**Advanced:**
- Weeks 1-4: Optional 2x/week 15-20min Zone 2 cardio (bike, walk) on off-days or post-lift. Keeps conditioning baseline without interfering with recovery.
- Weeks 5-8: Reduce to 1x/week 15min if desired. Priority shifts to lifting recovery.
- Weeks 9-12: No conditioning. All energy reserved for peaking and competition prep.

**Key differences:**
- Beginner: Minimal, unstructured (optional, no frequency)
- Intermediate: Structured (2-3x/week, specific timing/purpose)
- **Advanced: Periodized conditioning (decreases as peaking progresses: 2x → 1x → 0x)**
- **Advanced: Explicitly eliminates conditioning during peaking (Weeks 9-12) to reserve energy**
- **Advanced: Conditioning seen as interference during peaking phase (not beneficial)**

## Use Cases

### 1. Agent Training
- **Beginner example:** Teach agent to parse simple linear progression
- **Intermediate example:** Teach agent to parse block periodization (accumulation → intensification)
- **Advanced example:** Teach agent to parse sport-specific peaking cycles with competition endpoints
- **Together:** Show agent how complexity, periodization, and specificity scale with experience level

### 2. Agent Evaluation
Compare agent output for advanced plan against this benchmark. Check for:
- ✅ Sport-specific goal captured (powerlifting competition)
- ✅ Linear periodization toward peak (4 blocks with distinct volume/intensity/RPE targets)
- ✅ RPE-based auto-regulation on every main lift (not just deload triggers)
- ✅ Wave loading mentioned (Weeks 5-8: 80% → 82.5% → 85%)
- ✅ Peaking block specifics (heavy triples → doubles → singles, 90-97.5% 1RM)
- ✅ Taper protocol (Week 12: volume cut, openers Wednesday, rest Thu-Sat, compete Sunday)
- ✅ Accessory progression across blocks (3-4 sets → 3 sets → 2 sets or eliminated)
- ✅ Conditioning periodization (2x → 1x → 0x as peaking progresses)
- ✅ Competition-day considerations (nutrition, sleep, warm-up protocols)

### 3. UI Development
Test plan detail views with advanced sport-specific complexity:
- 4-block periodization visualization (accumulation → strength → peaking → taper)
- RPE tracking and auto-regulation alerts (if RPE deviates ±1 point)
- Competition countdown (weeks/days until meet)
- Taper week special display (openers, rest days, competition day)
- Accessory volume tracking across blocks (decreases as peaking progresses)
- Conditioning schedule that adapts by block

### 4. Schema Validation
- Validate that `PlanStructure` schema accommodates sport-specific plans with competition endpoints
- Test schema flexibility for various periodization types (linear toward peak, not just block or linear progression)
- Ensure schema captures auto-regulation sophistication (RPE-based adjustments on every set)

## Quality Standards

This advanced example meets all standards:

### ✅ Schema Compliance
- All required fields present
- Proper array structures
- 7-day schedule template

### ✅ Advanced-Appropriate Complexity
- Sport-specific goal (powerlifting competition)
- Linear periodization toward peak (4 distinct blocks)
- RPE-based auto-regulation on every main lift
- Wave loading (weekly intensity undulation)
- Peaking protocols (heavy triples → doubles → singles)
- Taper protocol (Week 12 day-by-day)
- Accessory work that adapts across blocks
- Conditioning that decreases as peaking progresses

### ✅ Specificity
- Not vague ("get stronger for competition")
- Actionable ("Week 10: 92.5% 3x2, adjust ±5-10% if RPE deviates ±1")
- Concrete ("Wednesday: Openers only. Thursday-Saturday: Complete rest. Sunday: Competition day.")

### ✅ Consistency
- Schedule frequency (4) matches training days (Mon/Tue/Thu/Sat)
- Duration (12 weeks) matches block breakdown (4 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 12)
- Progression strategy blocks align with duration
- Taper week (Week 12) ends on Sunday (competition day)

## Design Decisions

**Why 12 weeks instead of 16?** — 12 weeks is a typical powerlifting peaking cycle (4 weeks accumulation, 4 weeks strength building, 3 weeks peaking, 1 week taper). Longer cycles risk overreaching before competition.

**Why 4 days/week instead of 6?** — Heavy compound lifts (squat/bench/deadlift at 80-97.5% 1RM) require more CNS and joint recovery than hypertrophy work. 4 days allows 3 rest/active recovery days per week.

**Why Upper/Lower split instead of PPL or Full Body?** — Allows 2-3x frequency on competition lifts (squat appears Mon + Thu, bench appears Tue + Sat) while managing fatigue. Each lift gets a primary (heavy) and secondary (lighter/volume) day.

**Why linear periodization instead of block?** — Competition endpoint creates a timeline. Linear periodization toward peak (volume decreases as intensity increases) is most effective for peaking toward specific date.

**Why RPE-based auto-regulation on every set?** — Advanced lifters can accurately gauge RPE. Allows day-to-day load adjustments (±5-10%) based on readiness, preventing overtraining or undertraining.

**Why wave loading in Weeks 5-8?** — Weekly intensity undulation (80% → 82.5% → 85% → deload) provides progressive overload while managing fatigue. Week 8 deload dissipates accumulated fatigue before peaking block.

**Why eliminate conditioning during Weeks 9-12?** — Peaking block requires all energy reserves for heavy singles (95-97.5% 1RM). Conditioning creates interference effect (competes for recovery resources). Eliminated to maximize peak performance.

**Why taper week (Week 12) is non-negotiable?** — Taper dissipates fatigue while maintaining peak. Skipping taper results in competition performance 5-15% below potential. Taper is physiological necessity, not optional.

**Why openers on Wednesday, rest Thu-Sat, compete Sunday?** — Openers (easy attempts at opening weights) confirm readiness without fatigue cost. Thursday-Saturday complete rest allows full recovery. Sunday competition is common meet schedule.

## Extending This Pattern

For **Other Sport-Specific Plans**, expect similar structure:
- **Weightlifting (Olympic):** Peaking for snatch/clean & jerk, daily undulating periodization (DUP), positional work, technique emphasis
- **Bodybuilding:** Peak week (carb manipulation, water loading/cutting, posing practice), muscle-group specialization phases
- **CrossFit:** Competition prep (chipper workouts, metcon testing, skills refinement), concurrent training (strength + conditioning + skill)
- **Endurance Sports:** Taper protocols (volume reduction, intensity maintenance), race-week strategies

For **Other Advanced Methodologies**, expect:
- **Conjugate Method:** Max effort days (1-3RM lifts rotated weekly) + dynamic effort days (speed work at 50-60% 1RM)
- **Daily Undulating Periodization (DUP):** Heavy day (3-5 reps RPE 8-9), Moderate day (6-10 reps RPE 7-8), Light day (12-15 reps RPE 6-7) rotated throughout week
- **Block Periodization (Advanced):** Accumulation (hypertrophy block) → Intensification (strength block) → Realization (peaking block) with distinct training focuses per block
- **Auto-Regulated Progressive Resistance Exercise (APRE):** Set 1 at 50% estimated 6RM, Set 2 at 75% estimated 6RM, Set 3 AMRAP at 100% estimated 6RM, Set 4 adjusted based on Set 3 reps
