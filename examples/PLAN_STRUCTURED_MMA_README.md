# MMA Fight Camp plan:structured Example

## Purpose

Reference example demonstrating the `plan:structured` agent output for a **sport-specific MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) fight camp** program.

Shows how the `plan:structured` agent should parse and structure an 8-week fight camp integrating strength, power, and conditioning alongside technical training (striking, grappling, sparring).

## Plan Overview

- **Name**: MMA Fight Camp — 8-Week Strength & Conditioning
- **Type**: MMA-Specific S&C
- **Duration**: 8 weeks (standard fight camp timeline from announcement to fight night)
- **Frequency**: 6 days/week (strength 3x, conditioning 2-3x, technical training 4-6x integrated)
- **Structure**: Base Building (Weeks 1-3) → Fight-Specific Prep (Weeks 4-6) → Peak/Taper (Weeks 7-8)
- **Target**: Fighters preparing for MMA competition (amateur or professional)

## Three-Block Periodization

### Block 1 — Base Building (Weeks 1-3)
**Goal**: Establish strength and aerobic base without excessive fatigue

**Strength** (3x/week):
- Compound lifts: Squat, Deadlift, Press, Pull
- Loads: 70-75% 1RM
- Volume: 3-4 sets × 6-8 reps
- RPE: 7-8 (moderate intensity)

**Conditioning**:
- Aerobic: 2-3x/week, 20-30min Zone 2 (roadwork, bike, swim)
- Anaerobic: 1-2x/week, 6-10 rounds × 30sec hard/90sec easy
- No alactic work yet

**Technical Training**: 4-5 sessions/week (moderate volume)

**Rationale**: Build mitochondrial density (aerobic base) and foundational strength. Moderate technical volume allows focus on physical development. Aerobic base enables faster recovery between rounds and sessions throughout camp.

---

### Block 2 — Fight-Specific Preparation (Weeks 4-6)
**Goal**: Develop explosive power and fight-specific conditioning

**Strength** (2x/week, reduced from 3x):
- Explosive variations: Box squats, Power cleans, Push press
- Loads: 70-75% (maintained)
- Volume: 3 sets × 3-5 reps (reduced to manage fatigue)
- Intent: Explosive, not grinding

**Conditioning**:
- Anaerobic: 3x/week, 5min round structure (30sec hard/30sec moderate)
- Alactic: 2x/week, 8-12 rounds × 10sec sprint/50sec rest
- Aerobic: 1-2x/week, 15-20min Zone 2 (recovery only)

**Technical Training**: 6 sessions/week (peak volume, includes sparring)

**Rationale**: Shift to fight-specific energy systems (anaerobic capacity for 5min rounds, alactic power for explosive bursts). Technical volume peaks—S&C volume reduces to prevent overtraining. Explosive intent in strength work develops knockout power and takedown explosiveness.

---

### Block 3 — Peak & Taper (Weeks 7-8)
**Week 7 — Final Peak**:
- Strength: 1x, 70%, 2-3 sets × 3 reps (explosive)
- Conditioning: 2x fight-specific 5min rounds, 1x alactic power
- Sparring: Intensity peaks (final hard sparring before taper)

**Week 8 — Taper**:
- Strength: 1x light (60%, 2×3, technique only)
- Conditioning: 1x short (3 rounds × 3min, moderate pace)
- NO sparring last 4 days
- Volume reduction: 70-80% cut from Week 7

**Rationale**: Week 7 is final hard week to peak all systems. Week 8 dissipates fatigue while maintaining sharpness. Dramatic volume reduction allows fighter to arrive at fight night fresh, confident, and explosive. Focus shifts to recovery, hydration, weight management (if cutting), and mental preparation.

## MMA-Specific Programming Features

### 1. Multi-Modal Integration
**Unlike pure strength programs (beginner, intermediate, advanced)**:
- MMA plan integrates **strength + power + conditioning + technical training**
- S&C sessions scheduled around technical training (strength AM, technical PM)
- Sparring days have NO heavy S&C (prioritize skill sharpness, injury prevention)

**Schedule example (Week 4)**:
- Monday AM: Strength (lower body), PM: Technical (striking)
- Tuesday AM: Conditioning (anaerobic), PM: Technical (grappling)
- Wednesday AM: Strength (upper body, light if sparring), PM: Sparring (high intensity)
- Thursday AM: Conditioning (alactic), PM: Technical (drilling)
- Friday AM: Strength (explosive full body), PM: Technical (light drilling)
- Saturday: Aerobic conditioning OR light sparring (alternates)
- Sunday: Complete rest

### 2. Energy System Periodization
**Three energy systems targeted**:

**Aerobic (Oxidative)**:
- Target: Mitochondrial density, recovery capacity
- Training: 20-30min Zone 2 cardio (roadwork, bike, swim)
- Emphasis: Weeks 1-3 (base building)
- Purpose: Faster recovery between rounds and between sessions

**Anaerobic (Glycolytic)**:
- Target: Sustain high output during 5min MMA rounds
- Training: 5min round structure (30sec hard/30sec moderate × 5 rounds)
- Emphasis: Weeks 4-6 (fight-specific prep)
- Purpose: Match fight demands (UFC: 3×5min or 5×5min rounds)

**Alactic (Phosphagen)**:
- Target: Explosive power for knockouts and takedowns
- Training: 8-12 rounds × 10sec sprint/50sec rest (prowler, hill sprints, heavy bag blitzes)
- Emphasis: Weeks 4-6 (fight-specific prep)
- Purpose: Develop explosive bursts (takedown attempts, knockout combinations, scrambles)

**Progression**: Build aerobic base (Weeks 1-3) → peak anaerobic + alactic (Weeks 4-6) → taper all systems (Weeks 7-8)

### 3. Interference Effect Management
**Strength and conditioning NOT scheduled same day**:
- **Strength days**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday
- **Conditioning days**: Tuesday, Thursday, (Saturday optional)
- **Why**: Concurrent training (strength + endurance same day) reduces strength gains (interference effect). Separating modalities optimizes both.

**Exception**: Light technical training (drilling, pad work) can follow strength sessions (AM strength, PM technical) because skill work is low-intensity and doesn't interfere significantly.

### 4. Recovery-Centric Auto-Regulation
**S&C adapts to technical load, not vice versa**:
- If sparring is scheduled (Wednesday, Saturday), S&C is light or skipped
- If technical volume spikes unexpectedly, next S&C session is skipped
- If morning resting heart rate is 10+ bpm above baseline, hard session becomes light technical or rest

**Triggers for immediate S&C reduction**:
- Resting heart rate elevation (10+ bpm above baseline)
- Excessive soreness or joint pain
- Sleep disruption (indicator of overtraining)
- Unexpected technical volume increase (extra sparring session added)

**Rationale**: MMA technical training (sparring, grappling) creates high systemic fatigue. S&C must support technical development, not hinder it. Fighter's primary goal is skill sharpness on fight night, not deadlift PR.

### 5. Weight Cut Considerations (Weeks 7-8)
**If fighter is cutting weight**:
- Reduce S&C volume 50%
- Eliminate hard anaerobic conditioning (preserve glycogen)
- Manage cortisol (avoid excessive stress)
- Hydration and electrolyte protocols critical
- NO hard conditioning last 3 days before weigh-in

**Rationale**: Weight cutting is physiologically stressful (dehydration, glycogen depletion, cortisol elevation). S&C must adapt to preserve energy for weight management and subsequent rehydration.

### 6. Fight-Specific Conditioning Structure
**5min round intervals** (Weeks 4-6, 3x/week):
- Matches UFC round structure (3×5min or 5×5min)
- Work-to-rest ratio: 30sec hard/30sec moderate
- Total: 5 rounds × 5min = 25min (matches championship fight duration)
- Modalities: Rowing, bike, heavy bag combinations, shadow boxing with weights

**Rationale**: Specificity principle—conditioning should match fight demands. 5min rounds train fighter to sustain high output for exact duration they'll face in competition.

### 7. Sparring Integration
**Wednesday & Saturday are sparring days**:
- Wednesday: Mid-week sparring (moderate to hard rounds)
- Saturday: Weekend sparring (alternates with aerobic work depending on week)

**S&C adjustments on sparring days**:
- Wednesday AM strength: Light loads (60-70%) or skip entirely
- Saturday: NO heavy S&C (sparring is primary stimulus)
- NO conditioning same day as sparring (CNS fatigue management)

**Rationale**: Sparring is highest-priority training for skill development and mental preparation. S&C cannot interfere with sparring performance or increase injury risk during live training.

### 8. Explosive Power Emphasis
**Alactic power work** (Weeks 4-6, 2x/week):
- 8-12 rounds × 10sec sprint/50sec rest
- Modalities: Prowler pushes, hill sprints, heavy bag blitzes, medicine ball slams
- Purpose: Develop explosive power for:
  - Takedown attempts (explosive penetration step)
  - Knockout power (fast-twitch fiber recruitment)
  - Scrambles (explosive escapes from bad positions)

**Strength work explosive intent** (Weeks 4-6):
- Box squats (concentric explosion)
- Power cleans (full-body explosive power)
- Push press (explosive overhead strength for collar ties)

**Rationale**: MMA requires explosive bursts throughout 5min rounds. Alactic system training (10sec max efforts) specifically develops this capacity.

## Key Design Decisions

### Why 8 Weeks (vs 12-16 for other plans)?
**8 weeks is standard MMA fight camp duration**:
- Fight announcement → fight night typically 6-10 weeks
- 8 weeks allows: 3 weeks base, 3 weeks fight-specific, 2 weeks peak/taper
- Shorter than strength programs because goal is peaking existing fitness, not building from scratch

### Why 6 Days/Week (vs 3-6 for other plans)?
**MMA requires high frequency but manages fatigue**:
- Strength 3x, Conditioning 2-3x, Technical 4-6x = 6-day schedule
- Sunday complete rest non-negotiable (cumulative fatigue from multi-modal training)
- Higher frequency than pure strength programs, but each session is shorter and more specific

### Why Separate Strength and Conditioning Days?
**Interference effect management**:
- Concurrent training (strength + endurance same day) reduces strength gains by ~30%
- Separating modalities allows both to progress optimally
- Exception: Light technical work after strength (AM/PM split) doesn't interfere significantly

### Why Schedule S&C Around Sparring (not vice versa)?
**Sparring is highest priority for skill development**:
- Fighter's primary goal: Win fight through superior skill, not superior deadlift
- Heavy S&C on sparring days increases injury risk
- Fatigued muscles reduce sparring quality and defensive ability
- Principle: S&C serves technical training, not the other way around

### Why Three Energy Systems?
**MMA demands all three**:
- **Aerobic**: Recover between rounds, maintain output across 3-5 rounds
- **Anaerobic**: Sustain high-intensity exchanges for 30-60sec (typical MMA exchange duration)
- **Alactic**: Explosive bursts (knockout combinations, takedown attempts, scrambles)
- All three must be trained, but emphasis shifts across camp (aerobic → anaerobic/alactic → taper)

### Why Weight Cut Protocols?
**Many MMA fighters cut weight**:
- Weight class system incentivizes cutting 10-20lbs to gain size advantage
- Weight cutting is physiologically stressful (dehydration, glycogen depletion, cortisol)
- S&C must adapt: reduce volume 50%, eliminate hard conditioning, manage hydration/electrolytes
- Failure to adapt S&C during weight cut risks injury, illness, or poor performance

## File Stats
- **File Size**: ~11KB
- **Blocks**: 3 (Base Building, Fight-Specific Prep, Peak/Taper)
- **Duration**: 8 weeks
- **Frequency**: 6 days/week
- **Energy Systems**: 3 (Aerobic, Anaerobic, Alactic)
- **S&C Sessions**: Strength 3x/week (Weeks 1-3), 2x/week (Weeks 4-6), 1x/week (Weeks 7-8)

- **Technical Training**: 4-6 sessions/week (integrated, not prescribed in S&C plan)

## Notes
- MMA plan is fundamentally different from strength-focused plans (beginner, intermediate, advanced, time-constrained)
- Primary difference: Multi-modal integration (strength + power + conditioning + technical training)
- S&C is secondary to technical training—scheduled around sparring, not vice versa
- Energy system periodization is core feature (not mentioned in strength plans, eliminated in powerlifting peak)
- 8-week duration matches standard fight camp timeline (shorter than 12-16 week strength programs)
- Taper protocol is critical (Week 8: 70-80% volume reduction, no hard conditioning, no sparring last 4 days)
- Auto-regulation is recovery-centric (HR monitoring, soreness, technical volume spikes) vs load-centric (RPE only)
- Weight cut considerations are MMA-specific (not relevant to general fitness or strength sports)
- Fight-specific conditioning (5min rounds) matches competition demands (UFC: 3×5min or 5×5min)
- Explosive power emphasis (alactic work) develops knockout power and takedown explosiveness
