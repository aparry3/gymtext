# Workout:Generate Examples: Advanced Week 2 (Mon, Tue, Thu)

Structured workout examples for Advanced Powerlifting Peaking plan, Week 2 (Accumulation phase).

## Note on Day Selection

The task requested "Mon, Tue, Fri" but **Friday is a rest day** in Week 2 of the Advanced plan. These examples cover:
- **Monday:** Squat emphasis (primary squat day)
- **Tuesday:** Bench emphasis (primary bench day)
- **Thursday:** Deadlift emphasis (primary deadlift day)

These three days showcase all three competition lifts during the accumulation phase.

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate:
- **How `workout:generate` should structure advanced powerlifting workouts**
- **Competition lift programming** (5×5 squat/bench, 5×4 deadlift @ 70-75% RPE 7-8)
- **Secondary variations** (pause squats, close-grip bench, deficit deadlifts)
- **Detailed execution cues** (setup, bar path, common mistakes, safety)
- **Upper/Lower split structure** with appropriate rest periods

## Workout Overview

| Day | Focus | Main Lift | Secondary | Accessories | Duration |
|-----|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Mon | Squat | 5×5 @ RPE 7-8 | Pause squat 4×3 | RDL, Bulgarian, leg press | 85 min |
| Tue | Bench | 5×5 @ RPE 7-8 | Close-grip 4×6 | Incline press, rows, face pulls, triceps | 80 min |
| Thu | Deadlift | 5×4 @ RPE 7-8 | Deficit DL 4×3 | Front squat 3×6, GHR, leg curls | 90 min |

## Key Features

### Competition Lift Programming

**Volume:** 5×5 for squat/bench, 5×4 for deadlift
- Higher volume than peaking phase (Week 10: 3×2)
- Lower volume than true hypertrophy (intermediate: 4×8)
- Optimal for strength development while building work capacity

**Intensity:** RPE 7-8 (~70-75% 1RM)
- Moderate intensity (leave 2-3 reps in reserve)
- Allows quality reps and bar speed
- Builds volume tolerance without excessive fatigue

**Progression Guidance:**
- "If Week 1 felt RPE 7, add 5-10lbs"
- "If RPE 8.5, hold weight and focus on bar speed"
- RPE-based auto-regulation integrated

### Secondary Variations

**Purpose:** Address weak points without excessive fatigue

**Monday — Pause Squats (4×3 @ RPE 7):**
- Addresses weakness out of the hole
- Teaches patience and position maintenance
- 2sec pause at parallel, stay tight, explosive drive

**Tuesday — Close-Grip Bench (4×6 @ RPE 7-8):**
- Lockout and triceps strength
- Hands shoulder-width, elbows tucked
- Builds top portion of bench press

**Thursday — Deficit Deadlifts (4×3 @ RPE 7):**
- Off-the-floor strength (where most lifters are weakest)
- Stand on 1-2" platform, increases ROM
- Reinforces proper setup position

### Accessory Strategy

**Monday (Squat Day):**
- RDL 3×8: Hamstring/glute hypertrophy, posterior chain balance
- Bulgarian split squat 3×10/leg: Unilateral, addresses imbalances
- Leg press 3×12-15: Quad volume without spinal load

**Tuesday (Bench Day):**
- Incline DB press 3×8-10: Upper chest hypertrophy
- Barbell row 4×8: Upper back thickness (critical for bench stability)
- Face pulls 3×15-20: Rear delt/shoulder health (non-negotiable)
- DB triceps extension 3×10-12: Triceps hypertrophy

**Thursday (Deadlift Day):**
- Front squat 3×6: Secondary squat work, maintains frequency
- GHR/Nordic curls 3×8-10: Posterior chain hypertrophy
- Leg curls 3×12-15: Hamstring isolation

### Detailed Execution Cues

**Every main lift includes:**
- **Setup instructions:** Foot/hand position, body positioning, breathing/bracing
- **Execution details:** Bar path, tempo, key focus points
- **Common mistakes:** What to avoid (dive-bombing, shooting hips up, bar drift)
- **Recording instructions:** Weight, reps, RPE, bar speed notes, form issues
- **Purpose explanation:** Why this variation/exercise is included

**Example (Competition Squat):**
```
Setup: Bar on traps, feet shoulder-width, toes slightly out
Execution: Big breath and brace, descend 2-3sec, depth to parallel+,
drive explosively
Focus: Maintain bracing, no dive-bombing, speed off the bottom
Record: weight, reps, RPE per set, bar speed (fast/moderate/slow)
```

### Safety Integration

**Monday:**
- "If bar speed slows significantly on rep 4-5, you're too heavy—reduce next set"
- Pause squat: "Don't relax in the hole—stay tight"

**Tuesday:**
- "Unrack with assistance if heavy"
- "Don't hyperextend elbows at lockout"
- Face pulls: "Do these even when tired—shoulder health is non-negotiable"

**Thursday:**
- "Don't grind reps—if bar speed slows significantly, stop set"
- "If you feel back starting to round, stop set"
- "Don't drop bar aggressively—controlled descent prevents injury"

## Section Structure

Each workout follows this structure:

### 1. Warm-Up (10-15 min)
- Light cardio (5 min)
- Dynamic mobility (leg swings, arm circles, hip openers)
- Movement-specific preparation (empty bar work, build-up sets)
- **Purpose:** Prepare joints, activate muscles, groove movement patterns

### 2. Main Lift (20-30 min)
- Competition squat/bench/deadlift
- 5 working sets with 3min rest
- Detailed setup and execution cues
- Recording instructions

### 3. Secondary Variation (15-20 min)
- Pause squat / close-grip bench / deficit deadlift
- 4 sets with 2-3min rest
- Purpose: address weak points
- Lower intensity than main lift

### 4. Accessories (25-30 min)
- 3-4 exercises, 3 sets each
- 90sec-2min rest depending on exercise
- Mix of compounds (rows, front squat) and isolation (leg curls, face pulls)

### 5. Cooldown (5-10 min)
- Static stretching (30-60sec holds)
- Foam rolling (optional, 5-10min)
- Light movement (walking) for Thursday

## Comparison: Beginner vs Intermediate vs Advanced

### Volume per Session

| Level | Exercises | Sets (Main Lift) | Total Sets | Duration |
|-------|-----------|------------------|------------|----------|
| Beginner | 6-8 | 2-3 | 15-20 | 45-60 min |
| Intermediate | 6-9 | 3-4 | 20-27 | 65-75 min |
| Advanced | 9-12 | 5 | 20-25 | 80-90 min |

Advanced has higher main lift volume (5 sets vs 3-4) but similar total volume due to fewer isolation exercises.

### Rep Ranges

| Level | Main Lifts | Accessories | Purpose |
|-------|------------|-------------|---------|
| Beginner | 12-15 | 12-15 | Skill acquisition, low injury risk |
| Intermediate | 6-10 (compounds), 10-20 (isolation) | 8-15 | Hypertrophy spectrum |
| Advanced | 4-5 | 6-15 | Strength, specific to competition |

### Execution Detail

**Beginner Monday Squat:**
- "2-3 sets × 12-15 reps, RPE 5-6 (light)"
- "Focus on depth and form"
- "Rest 60-90s"

**Intermediate Monday Squat:**
- "4×8 @ RPE 7-8 (~70-75% 1RM)"
- "3sec descent, 1sec pause, explosive up"
- "Rest 2-3min"
- "Track weight used"

**Advanced Monday Squat:**
- "5×5 @ RPE 7-8 (~70-75% 1RM). If Week 1 felt RPE 7, add 5-10lbs."
- "Setup: Bar on traps, feet shoulder-width, big breath and brace"
- "Execution: 2-3sec descent, depth to parallel+, drive explosively"
- "Focus: Speed off the bottom. If bar speed slows significantly on rep 4-5, reduce next set."
- "Record: weight, actual reps, RPE per set, bar speed notes (fast/moderate/slow)"

### Secondary Variations

| Level | Variations? | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Beginner | None | Focus on learning main movements |
| Intermediate | Some (tempo squats) | Introduction to variation |
| Advanced | Yes (pause/close-grip/deficit) | Address weak points systematically |

### Accessory Complexity

**Beginner:** Generic (goblet squat, DB bench, DB RDL)
**Intermediate:** Specific (pull-ups vs lat pulldown, barbell row vs chest-supported)
**Advanced:** Weak-point targeted (pause squats if weak out of hole, GHRs for posterior chain)

## Design Decisions

**Why 5×5 for squat/bench but 5×4 for deadlift?**
- Deadlifts are more fatiguing (grip, CNS, lower back demands)
- One fewer rep per set allows maintaining quality and bar speed
- Still significant volume (20 total reps)

**Why secondary variations immediately after main lift?**
- Similar movement pattern (neuromuscular priming)
- Still relatively fresh (can handle technical work)
- Targets weak point while pattern is grooved

**Why front squats on Thursday instead of Monday?**
- Thursday is deadlift day (lower CNS demand than heavy back squat day)
- Maintains squat frequency (2x per week: Mon primary, Thu secondary)
- Lighter load (60-65% back squat 1RM) — not competing with heavy deadlifts

**Why such detailed execution cues?**
- Advanced lifters need precision at 70-95% loads
- Injury prevention at heavier weights
- Teaches self-assessment (bar speed, form breakdown)
- Empowers auto-regulation

**Why include "record" instructions?**
- Data-driven progression essential for advanced training
- Tracks week-to-week changes (weight, RPE accuracy, bar speed)
- Informs next week's loading decisions
