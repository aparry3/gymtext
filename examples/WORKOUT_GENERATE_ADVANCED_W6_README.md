# Workout:Generate Examples: Advanced Week 6 (Mon, Tue, Thu)

Structured workout examples for Advanced Powerlifting Peaking plan, Week 6 (Strength Building / Wave Loading phase).

## Note on Day Selection

The task requested "Mon, Tue, Fri" but **Friday is a rest day** in Week 6 of the Advanced plan. These examples cover:
- **Monday:** Squat emphasis (82.5% 4×3)
- **Tuesday:** Bench emphasis (82.5% 4×3)
- **Thursday:** Deadlift emphasis (82.5% 4×2-3)

These three days showcase all three competition lifts during the wave loading peak (Week 2 of 80%→82.5%→85% progression).

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate:
- **How `workout:generate` should structure wave loading workouts**
- **Competition lift intensification** (82.5% 1RM, 4×3 for squat/bench, 4×2-3 for deadlift)
- **Volume reduction with intensity increase** (from Week 2's 5×5 @ 70-75%)
- **Bar speed monitoring** (critical at 82.5%—if third rep grinds >3sec, reduce weight)
- **Accessory reduction** (preserve energy for heavy compounds)

## Workout Overview

| Day | Focus | Main Lift | Secondary | Accessories | Duration |
|-----|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Mon | Squat | 4×3 @ 82.5% RPE 8-9 | Front squat 3×5 | RDL 3×6-8, leg press 3×10-12 | 80 min |
| Tue | Bench | 4×3 @ 82.5% RPE 8-9 | Close-grip 3×5 | Rows 3×6-8, incline press 3×8-10, face pulls | 75 min |
| Thu | Deadlift | 4×2-3 @ 82.5% RPE 8-9 | Deficit DL 3×2 | Front squat 3×5, GHR 3×8 | 85 min |

## Key Features

### Wave Loading Progression

**Context:** Weeks 5-8 use wave loading to progressively increase intensity:
- **Week 5:** 80% 1RM, 4×4 @ RPE 8-9 (16 total reps)
- **Week 6:** 82.5% 1RM, 4×3 @ RPE 8-9 (12 total reps) ← **these examples**
- **Week 7:** 85% 1RM, 3×3 @ RPE 9 (9 total reps)
- **Week 8:** Deload at 70-75% of Week 7

**Philosophy:** Volume decreases (sets×reps), intensity increases (percentage), RPE remains high (8-9+).

**Week 6 Specifics:**
- Loads increase to 82.5% 1RM (from Week 5's 80%)
- Reps per set decrease to 3 (from Week 5's 4)
- Total volume: 12 reps (vs 16 in Week 5, vs 20-25 in Week 2 accumulation)
- RPE 8-9: Only 1-2 reps left in reserve—challenging but controlled

### Bar Speed as Critical Metric

**Why it matters at 82.5%:**
- Bar speed indicates fatigue and readiness
- Grinding reps (>3-4sec) suggests excessive load
- Form breakdown more likely when speed drops
- Auto-regulation prevents injury

**Monday (Squat):**
- "Third rep should be challenging but fast—if it grinds (>3sec), reduce weight 10lbs next set"
- "Bar speed check: first rep should move well, second rep slows slightly, third rep is hard but should complete in <3sec"

**Tuesday (Bench):**
- "If bar stalls mid-press or takes >3sec, reduce 5lbs next set"
- "Third rep challenging but controlled—if it stalls mid-press, reduce next set"

**Thursday (Deadlift):**
- "If second or third rep grinds significantly (>4-5sec) or form breaks down, stop set and reduce 10lbs next set"
- "Some lifters can only manage 2 clean reps at 82.5%—that's fine"

### Reduced Accessory Volume

**Comparison to Week 2 (Accumulation):**

| Exercise | Week 2 (Accumulation) | Week 6 (Wave Loading) |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Main Lift | 5×5 or 5×4 | 4×3 or 4×2-3 |
| Secondary Variation | 4×3-6 | 3×2-5 |
| Accessories | 3-4×8-15 | 3×6-12 (reduced reps) |

**Why reduce accessories?**
- Energy must be preserved for heavy compounds (82.5% is demanding)
- CNS fatigue accumulates faster at higher intensities
- Recovery capacity limited—prioritize competition lifts
- Accessories shift from hypertrophy focus to maintenance

**What stays?**
- Face pulls (shoulder health non-negotiable)
- Upper back work (critical for bench stability)
- Posterior chain basics (RDL, GHR)

**What's eliminated?**
- Bulgarian split squats (unilateral work removed)
- Dumbbell overhead triceps extensions (arm isolation reduced)
- Leg curls (redundant with GHR and deadlift work)

### Competition Lift Programming

**Volume:** 4×3 for squat/bench, 4×2-3 for deadlift
- Reduced from Week 2's 5×5/5×4
- Higher intensity compensates for lower volume
- Still sufficient for skill maintenance and strength gains

**Intensity:** RPE 8-9 (~82.5% 1RM)
- High intensity (only 1-2 reps in reserve)
- Third rep is challenging but should move without significant grinding
- Bar speed critical indicator—if slows excessively, reduce load

**Progression Guidance:**
- "If Week 5 (80%) felt RPE 8, then 82.5% should feel RPE 8.5-9 for 3 reps"
- "Competition > hitting percentages" (if form breaks, reduce load)
- Recording instructions comprehensive: weight, reps, RPE, bar speed per rep, form notes

### Thursday Deadlift Specifics

**Why 4×2-3 instead of 4×3?**
- Deadlifts are more fatiguing than squats/bench (grip, posterior chain, CNS demands)
- Some lifters can only manage 2 clean reps at 82.5%—that's acceptable
- Quality > quantity—better to do 2 perfect reps than 3 with form breakdown

**Safety guidance:**
- "If first rep is RPE 9.5, do NOT attempt second rep (injury risk)"
- "If second or third rep grinds significantly (>4-5sec) or form breaks down (back rounds, hips shoot up), stop set"
- "Lower with control (controlled descent prevents injury)"

### Setup Emphasis at High Intensity

**All main lifts include extensive setup instructions:**

**Squat Setup:**
- "Maximum tightness—big breath (fill belly and brace), upper back locked (squeeze bar into traps), confident approach"
- "Walkout: 2-3 steps max, no repositioning (wastes energy)"
- "Pause 0.5sec at bottom (maintain tension, don't relax)"

**Bench Setup:**
- "Perfect setup critical at 82.5%—feet planted, arch locked, shoulder blades retracted and pinned, grip secure, spotter present"
- "Unrack with spotter assist (save energy)"
- "Pause 0.5sec at chest (maintain tension, feel bar but don't relax)"

**Deadlift Setup (MOST CRITICAL):**
- "Feet hip-width, bar over mid-foot, shins vertical, mixed/hook grip, chest up, lats engaged (pull slack out—feel tension before pulling)"
- "Big breath and brace (360° brace—belly, sides, lower back)"
- "Each warm-up set: perfect setup, focus on bracing and lat engagement"

## Section Structure

Each workout follows this structure:

### 1. Warm-Up (10-20 min)
- Light cardio (5 min)
- Dynamic mobility (hips, ankles, shoulders depending on day)
- Movement-specific preparation (empty bar work, build-up sets)
- **More deliberate build-ups** than accumulation (5-7 warm-up sets for deadlift)
- **Purpose:** CNS priming, groove movement patterns, build confidence at heavier loads

### 2. Main Lift (25-35 min)
- Competition squat/bench/deadlift at 82.5% 1RM
- 4 working sets with 3-4min rest (longer than accumulation's 3min)
- Detailed setup, execution, bar speed monitoring
- Recording: weight, reps, RPE, bar speed per rep, form notes

### 3. Secondary Variation (10-15 min)
- Front squat / close-grip bench / deficit deadlift
- 3 sets (reduced from Week 2's 4 sets)
- Lighter loads, shorter sets (3×5 or 3×2)
- Purpose: maintain movement patterns, preserve energy

### 4. Accessories (15-20 min)
- 2-3 exercises (reduced from Week 2's 3-4)
- 3 sets each, reduced reps
- Focus on essentials: posterior chain, upper back, shoulder health

### 5. Cooldown (5-10 min)
- Static stretching (focus on worked muscles)
- Foam rolling (light, avoid aggressive pressure when fatigued)
- Light movement (Thursday includes walking for lower back recovery)

## Comparison: Week 2 vs Week 6 vs Week 10

### Volume Progression

| Week | Phase | Squat | Bench | Deadlift | Total Reps |
|------|-------|-------|-------|----------|------------|
| 2 | Accumulation | 5×5 @ 70-75% | 5×5 @ 70-75% | 5×4 @ 70-75% | 25/25/20 |
| 6 | Wave Loading | 4×3 @ 82.5% | 4×3 @ 82.5% | 4×2-3 @ 82.5% | 12/12/8-12 |
| 10 | Peaking | 3×2 @ 92.5% | 3×2 @ 92.5% | 3×1-2 @ 92.5% | 6/6/3-6 |

**Inverse volume/intensity relationship:** As intensity increases, volume decreases.

### Rest Periods

| Week | Main Lifts | Secondaries | Accessories |
|------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 2 | 3 min | 2-3 min | 90sec-2min |
| 6 | 3-4 min | 3 min | 2 min |
| 10 | 4-5 min | 2-3 min | 2 min |

Week 6 increases rest for main lifts to ensure quality reps at higher intensity.

### Accessory Volume

| Week | Exercises | Total Sets | Rep Range | Focus |
|------|-----------|------------|-----------|-------|
| 2 | 9-12 | 20-25 | 8-15 | Hypertrophy, work capacity |
| 6 | 7-9 | 15-18 | 6-12 | Maintenance, energy preservation |
| 10 | 4-6 | 8-12 | 5-10 | Minimal, only essentials |

Week 6 is the transition point—accessories still present but reduced.

### Bar Speed Cues

| Week | Squat/Bench | Deadlift | Action |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| 2 | "If slows significantly on rep 4-5, reduce" | "If takes >4-5sec or back rounds, stop" | Guidance (not strict) |
| 6 | "If third rep grinds >3sec, reduce 5-10lbs" | "If >4-5sec or form breaks, reduce 10lbs" | Specific threshold |
| 10 | "If second rep grinds >5-6sec, stop set" | "If first rep is RPE 9.5, do NOT attempt second" | Strict rules |

Week 6 introduces specific bar speed thresholds (3sec for squat/bench, 4-5sec for deadlift).

## Quality Standards

These wave loading workouts meet all standards:

### ✅ Phase-Appropriate Programming
- 82.5% intensity appropriate for Wave Loading Week 2
- Volume reduced appropriately (12 total reps vs 20-25 in accumulation)
- Bar speed thresholds integrated (specific times, not vague)
- Accessory reduction preserves energy for main lifts

### ✅ Safety Integration
- Bar speed as fatigue indicator ("if third rep grinds >3sec, reduce")
- Form breakdown triggers ("if back rounds, stop set")
- Load reduction guidance specific ("reduce 5-10lbs next set")
- Competition > percentages philosophy ("if form breaks, reduce load")

### ✅ Auto-Regulation
- RPE-based loading (RPE 8-9, adjust if Week 5 felt different)
- Bar speed monitoring (objective measure, not just subjective RPE)
- Set-by-set adjustment ("reduce next set" not "reduce today")
- Individual variation acknowledged ("some lifters only manage 2 reps at 82.5%")

### ✅ Detailed Setup Instructions
- Every main lift includes extensive setup section
- Breath and bracing cues specific (360° brace, fill belly)
- Walkout economy (2-3 steps max, no repositioning)
- Pause timing specified (0.5sec, maintain tension)

### ✅ Recording Instructions
- Comprehensive data capture: weight, reps, RPE, bar speed per rep, form notes
- Guides next week's loading (Week 7: 85% 3×3)
- Informs whether wave loading is working (compare Week 5 → Week 6 progress)

## Design Decisions

**Why 4×3 instead of 3×3 at 82.5%?**
- 4 sets maintains skill practice (12 total reps)
- 3 reps per set allows quality (vs 4-5 reps which would grind at 82.5%)
- Prepares for Week 7's 3×3 @ 85% (similar set count, slightly heavier)

**Why 3-4min rest for main lifts (vs Week 2's 3min)?**
- 82.5% is neurally demanding (requires more recovery between sets)
- Bar speed quality matters—rushing rest leads to grinding reps
- Prepares for Week 10's 4-5min rest (even heavier loads)

**Why reduce accessories but keep face pulls?**
- Shoulder health is non-negotiable for powerlifters
- Face pulls low-fatigue (rear delts recover quickly)
- Balances pressing volume (prevents shoulder impingement)
- "Do these even when tired—shoulder health is non-negotiable"

**Why 4×2-3 for deadlift instead of 4×3?**
- Deadlifts uniquely fatiguing (grip, posterior chain, CNS all maximally taxed)
- Most lifters can't maintain quality for 3 reps at 82.5%
- 2 clean reps > 3 reps with form breakdown
- Prepares for Week 10's 3×1-2 @ 92.5%

**Why front squat on both Monday and Thursday?**
- Monday: Secondary squat work after heavy competition squat (3×5 @ RPE 8)
- Thursday: Lighter secondary squat work after deadlifts (3×5 @ RPE 7-8)
- Maintains squat frequency (2x per week for skill retention)
- Lighter on Thursday (60% back squat 1RM) to not compete with deadlifts

**Why more deliberate warm-ups than Week 2?**
- Higher working weight requires more progressive loading
- CNS needs more preparation for 82.5% vs 70-75%
- Injury prevention—underprepared warm-up at 82.5% is risky
- Build confidence—each warm-up set reinforces setup and technique
