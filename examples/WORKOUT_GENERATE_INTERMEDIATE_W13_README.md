# Workout:Generate Examples — Intermediate Week 13 INTENSIFICATION (Mon, Tue, Wed)

## Purpose
These examples demonstrate how the `workout:generate` agent should structure **peak intensification workouts** for intermediate-level trainees following the "Intermediate — Hypertrophy Focus" plan during Week 13 (final push before deload).

## Week Context
**Plan**: Intermediate — Hypertrophy Focus  
**Week**: 13 (of 16)  
**Phase**: Intensification (Weeks 9-14)  
**Goal**: Maximum hypertrophy stimulus through high loads + advanced techniques  
**Intensity**: RPE 8-9 (only 1-2 reps in reserve)  
**Volume**: 14-16 sets per muscle group (maintained from accumulation)  
**Load**: ~80-85% 1RM

## Workout Selection Rationale
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday represent the first half of Week 13's PPL split:

- **Monday (Day 1)**: Push — Chest & Shoulders (rest-pause bench, slow eccentric incline press, drop set lateral raises)
- **Tuesday (Day 2)**: Pull — Back & Biceps (rest-pause deadlift, slow eccentric pull-ups, drop set curls)
- **Wednesday (Day 3)**: Legs — Quad Emphasis (rest-pause squat, slow eccentric Bulgarian split squat, drop set leg extensions)

These three days showcase:
1. **Advanced technique integration** (rest-pause, drop sets, slow eccentrics)
2. **Peak intensity prescription** (RPE 8-9, 80-85% 1RM)
3. **Execution detail for safety** (form warnings, when to stop, assistance cues)
4. **Mental preparation** ("hardest week", "expect significant DOMS")

## Advanced Techniques Explained

### 1. Rest-Pause Sets
**What**: Take a set to near failure → rest 15-30sec → continue for 2-3 more reps  
**Where**: Final set of primary compound (bench press, deadlift, squat)  
**Why**: Pushes beyond standard failure, recruits additional motor units, increases mechanical tension

**Execution**:
- **Bench Press (Monday)**: 6 reps @ RPE 8-9 → rack bar → rest 15-20sec → 2-3 more reps
- **Deadlift (Tuesday)**: 5 reps @ RPE 8-9 → bar on floor → rest 20-30sec → 1-2 more reps
- **Squat (Wednesday)**: 6 reps @ RPE 8-9 → rack bar → rest 20sec → 2-3 more reps

**Safety notes**:
- Form must stay perfect during rest-pause reps — if it breaks down, stop immediately
- Deadlift: "Don't round your back chasing reps"
- Squat: "Don't collapse under the bar... maintain perfect form"
- Use spotter for bench press rest-pause

### 2. Slow Eccentrics (4-5sec)
**What**: Extend the negative (lowering) phase to 4-5 seconds on every rep  
**Where**: Final set of secondary compound (incline press, pull-ups, Bulgarian split squats)  
**Why**: Increases time under tension, creates more muscle damage, enhances hypertrophy stimulus

**Execution**:
- **Incline DB Press (Monday)**: 4-5sec descent on EVERY rep of final set (may drop to 6-8 reps due to fatigue)
- **Pull-ups/Lat Pulldown (Tuesday)**: 4-5sec descent on EVERY rep of final set (may need assistance for final reps)
- **Bulgarian Split Squat (Wednesday)**: 4-5sec descent on EVERY rep of final set ("this will light up your quads")

**Safety notes**:
- "Feel the stretch, control the weight, don't let it drop"
- "You may need assistance for balance—that's okay" (Bulgarian split squats)
- Rep count may drop (6-8 instead of 8-10) — that's expected due to increased time under tension

### 3. Drop Sets
**What**: Take set to failure → immediately reduce weight 30-40% → continue to failure again  
**Where**: Final set of isolation (lateral raises, barbell curls, leg extensions)  
**Why**: Metabolic stress, muscle pump, exhausts muscle fibers

**Execution**:
- **Lateral Raises (Monday)**: 12-15 reps to failure → drop weight 30-40% → 8-10 more reps
- **Barbell Curls (Tuesday)**: 8-10 reps to failure → drop weight 30% → 8-10 more reps
- **Leg Extensions (Wednesday)**: 12-15 reps to failure → drop weight 40% → 10-12 more reps

**Safety notes**:
- "Expect intense burn" / "Expect massive biceps pump" / "Expect significant burn"
- "Strict form even when burning/fatigued"
- Change weight IMMEDIATELY (no rest between failure and drop)

## Intensification vs. Accumulation vs. Deload

| Parameter | Accumulation (W1) | Deload (W7) | Intensification (W13) |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| **Sets** | 3-4 per exercise | **2 per exercise** | 3-4 per exercise |
| **Reps** | 6-15 (varies) | Same ranges | **6-15 (varies)** |
| **Load** | 100% working weight | 70-80% | **~110-120% of W1** |
| **Intensity** | RPE 7-8 (leave 2-3 RIR) | RPE 6-7 (leave 3-4 RIR) | **RPE 8-9 (leave 1-2 RIR)** |
| **Volume** | 12-14 sets/muscle | 6-7 sets/muscle | **14-16 sets/muscle** |
| **Advanced techniques** | **None** | None | **Rest-pause, drop sets, slow eccentrics** |
| **Rest (compounds)** | 90-120s | 90s | **2-3min** |
| **Rest (isolation)** | 60s | 60s | 60s |
| **Session time** | 65-75min | 40-50min | **70-80min** |
| **Mental framing** | "Track progress" | "Active recovery" | **"Hardest week", "Expect DOMS"** |

**Key insight**: Volume and rep ranges stay similar to accumulation, but load and intensity increase dramatically. Advanced techniques amplify stimulus beyond what standard sets can provide.

- Leg extensions drop set: "Expect significant burn"
- Closing: "Legs should feel torched. Expect significant DOMS tomorrow"

## Advanced Technique Placement Strategy

### Why Final Sets Only?
Advanced techniques are deployed on **final sets only** for strategic reasons:

**Rationale**:
1. **Fatigue management**: First 2-3 sets build volume with normal intensity
2. **Quality over quantity**: Maintain form on early sets, push limits on final set
3. **Neural preservation**: Save CNS for the final all-out effort
4. **Injury prevention**: Don't start fatigued (safer to push hard when fresh from rest)

**Example (Bench Press)**:
- Set 1: 6-8 reps @ RPE 8-9 (normal)
- Set 2: 6-8 reps @ RPE 8-9 (normal)
- Set 3: 6-8 reps @ RPE 8-9 (normal)
- **Set 4**: 6 reps → rest 15-20sec → 2-3 more (REST-PAUSE)

### One Technique Per Exercise
Each exercise gets **ONE advanced technique** (not multiple):

**Monday**:
- Bench press: Rest-pause (not rest-pause + slow eccentrics)
- Incline press: Slow eccentrics (not slow eccentrics + drop set)
- Lateral raises: Drop set (not drop set + rest-pause)

**Why**: Prevents excessive fatigue, maintains form quality, manageable cognitive load

### Technique Selection by Exercise Type

| Exercise Type | Technique | Rationale |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Primary compound** (bench, deadlift, squat) | Rest-pause | Pushes beyond failure, recruits more motor units, strength-specific |
| **Secondary compound** (incline press, pull-ups, Bulgarian split squat) | Slow eccentrics | Increases time under tension, muscle damage, hypertrophy-specific |
| **Isolation** (lateral raises, curls, leg extensions) | Drop sets | Metabolic stress, pump, fiber exhaustion |

## Safety & Execution Warnings

### Form is Still King
Every workout includes this reminder: **"Form is still king—advanced techniques amplify stimulus but also amplify injury risk if done sloppily."**

### Specific Safety Notes

**Deadlift Rest-Pause**:
- ⚠️ "Form is CRITICAL — don't round your back chasing reps"
- ⚠️ "If form breaks down, stop immediately"
- Rest period: 20-30sec (longer than bench/squat due to systemic fatigue)

**Squat Rest-Pause**:
- ⚠️ "Don't collapse under the bar"
- ⚠️ "Neurally demanding—stay focused"
- ⚠️ "Maintain perfect form"

**Slow Eccentrics**:
- ⚠️ "Don't let it drop" (incline press)
- ⚠️ "You may need assistance for balance" (Bulgarian split squats)
- ⚠️ "May need assistance for final reps—that's okay" (pull-ups)

**Drop Sets**:
- ⚠️ "Strict form even when burning" (lateral raises)
- ⚠️ "No momentum" (leg extensions)
- Change weight IMMEDIATELY (no rest between failure and drop)

## Mental Framing & Expectation Setting

Week 13 workouts include specific language to prepare trainees mentally:

**Before workouts**:
- "Hardest week of the program"
- "This creates mechanical tension, metabolic stress, and muscle damage—the three drivers of hypertrophy"
- "Push intelligently, not recklessly"

**During workouts**:
- "This is brutal but effective"
- "Expect intense burn" / "Expect massive biceps pump"
- "This will light up your quads"

**After workouts**:
- "You should feel thoroughly worked" (Monday)
- "Back should feel pumped and fatigued" (Tuesday)
- "Legs should feel torched. Expect significant DOMS tomorrow" (Wednesday)

**Purpose**: Set realistic expectations, normalize difficulty, emphasize safety

## Recovery Emphasis

### Sleep & Nutrition Non-Negotiable
Workouts include recovery notes:

**Monday cooldown**: "Stretching + light foam rolling (chest, shoulders, triceps)"  
**Tuesday cooldown**: "Back should feel pumped and fatigued"  
**Wednesday cooldown**: "Legs will be FRIED... Expect significant DOMS tomorrow"

**Week 13 context** (from microcycle):
- Sleep: 8-9 hours minimum (non-negotiable)
- Nutrition: Slight calorie surplus, 1g+ protein per lb bodyweight
- Hydration: Critical for advanced techniques (metabolic stress depletes glycogen/water)

### Why Foam Rolling Mentioned (Monday)
Monday is the only day that mentions foam rolling in cooldown:
- Chest, shoulders, triceps accumulate tension from heavy pressing
- Foam rolling may aid recovery between Monday → Thursday (second push day)
- Optional but recommended at this intensity

## Quality Standards

High-quality intensification workout:generate examples demonstrate:
- ✅ Advanced technique integration (rest-pause, drop sets, slow eccentrics)
- ✅ Final-set-only deployment (strategic fatigue management)
- ✅ One technique per exercise (prevents excessive fatigue)
- ✅ Specific execution details (rest periods, weight drops, tempo)
- ✅ Safety warnings (form critical, when to stop, assistance cues)
- ✅ RPE 8-9 throughout (peak intensity)
- ✅ Mental preparation ("hardest week", expectation setting)
- ✅ Recovery emphasis (sleep, nutrition, DOMS warnings)
- ✅ Session time realistic (70-80min due to advanced techniques)

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid these in intensification workouts:
- ❌ Advanced techniques on ALL sets (should be final sets only)
- ❌ Multiple techniques per exercise (rest-pause + drop set on same exercise)
- ❌ Missing execution details (need specific rest periods, weight drops, tempo)
- ❌ Insufficient safety warnings (form reminders critical at this intensity)
- ❌ RPE too low (<8) or too high (10, true failure on all sets)
- ❌ Missing mental framing (trainees need expectation setting)
- ❌ Downplaying difficulty ("this will be easy") — be honest about intensity
- ❌ No recovery notes (sleep/nutrition critical at peak intensity)
