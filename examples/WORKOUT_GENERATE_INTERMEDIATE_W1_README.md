# Workout:Generate Examples — Intermediate Week 1 (Mon, Tue, Wed)

## Purpose
These examples demonstrate how the `workout:generate` agent should structure daily workouts for **intermediate-level trainees** following the "Intermediate — Hypertrophy Focus" plan during Week 1 (Accumulation phase launch).

## Week Context
**Plan**: Intermediate — Hypertrophy Focus  
**Week**: 1 (of 16)  
**Phase**: Accumulation (Weeks 1-6)  
**Goal**: Establish baseline volume (12-14 sets/muscle), introduce PPL split structure  
**Intensity**: RPE 7-8 (moderate, leave 2-3 reps in reserve)

## Workout Selection Rationale
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday represent the first half of the PPL split:

- **Monday (Day 1)**: Push — Chest & Shoulders Emphasis
- **Tuesday (Day 2)**: Pull — Back & Biceps
- **Wednesday (Day 3)**: Legs — Quad Emphasis

These three days showcase:
1. **PPL split structure** (Push/Pull/Legs vs. beginner's full body)
2. **Intermediate volume** (12-16 sets per muscle group vs. beginner's 4-6 sets/week)
3. **Exercise categorization** (compounds → accessories → isolation)
4. **Detailed execution notes** (setup cues, focus points, alternatives)

## Key Differences: Beginner vs. Intermediate

| Dimension | Beginner W1 | Intermediate W1 |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Split** | Full body (3 days/week) | PPL (6 days/week) |
| **Volume per session** | 3-4 exercises | 6-9 exercises |
| **Volume per muscle** | 4-6 sets/week | 12-16 sets/week (2 sessions) |
| **Exercise categories** | No explicit categorization | Compounds → Accessories → Isolation |
| **Compound sets** | 2 sets | 3-4 sets |
| **Compound reps** | 12-15 | 6-12 (varies by movement) |
| **Intensity** | RPE 5-6 (light, learning) | RPE 7-8 (moderate, leave 2-3 RIR) |
| **Rest periods** | 60-90s (uniform) | 90-120s compounds, 60-90s accessories, 60s isolation |
| **Tempo cues** | 3-1-1 (introduced Day 3) | 3-1-X on squats (accumulation teaches control) |
| **Tracking emphasis** | Not mentioned | "Track weight used" on all compounds |
| **Alternatives** | Basic (push-ups vs bench) | Detailed (lat pulldown vs pull-ups, chest-supported row vs barbell row) |
| **Warm-up detail** | Light cardio + basic mobility | Light cardio + specific activation (scapular work, pattern primers) |
| **Session duration** | 45min | 65-75min |

## Exercise Structure & Categories

### Compounds (3-4 sets × 6-10 reps @ RPE 7-8)
**Purpose**: Main strength movements, highest mechanical tension  
**Rest**: 90-120s (deadlift/squat get 2-3min)  
**Examples**:
- Monday: Barbell bench press 4x8, Incline DB press 3x10-12, DB shoulder press 3x10
- Tuesday: Deadlift 4x6, Pull-ups 4x8-10, Barbell row 3x10-12
- Wednesday: Back squat 4x8, Leg press 3x12-15, Bulgarian split squat 3x10/leg

### Accessories (3 sets × 10-15 reps @ RPE 8)
**Purpose**: Volume work without excessive fatigue, allow pushing closer to failure  
**Rest**: 60-90s  
**Examples**:
- Monday: Machine chest press 3x12-15
- Tuesday: Single-arm DB row 3x12/arm, Face pulls 3x15-20
- Wednesday: RDL 3x12, Calf raises 4x15-20

### Isolation (2-3 sets × 12-20 reps @ RPE 8-9)
**Purpose**: Target specific muscles, metabolic stress, pump  
**Rest**: 60s  
**Examples**:
- Monday: Lateral raises 3x15-20, Overhead triceps extension 3x12-15
- Tuesday: Barbell curls 3x10-12, Hammer curls 3x12-15
- Wednesday: Leg extensions 3x15-20, Leg curls 3x15

## Section Structure

Each workout follows this section order:
1. **Warm-Up**: Light cardio + dynamic mobility + movement-specific activation
2. **Compounds**: Main strength movements (3-4 exercises)
3. **Accessories** (optional section): Volume work (1-3 exercises)
4. **Isolation**: Targeted muscle work (2-3 exercises)
5. **Cooldown**: Static stretching + optional foam rolling

This differs from beginner structure (Warm-Up → Workout → Core → Cooldown) by:
- Breaking "Workout" into Compounds/Accessories/Isolation (clearer organization)
- No dedicated Core section (core work integrated into compounds like squat/deadlift)
- Optional foam rolling (recovery tool for higher volume)

## Workout-by-Workout Breakdown

### Monday: Push (Chest & Shoulders Emphasis)
**Volume**: 12-14 sets chest, 10-12 shoulders, 6-8 triceps  
**Duration**: ~65min

**Flow**:
1. Warm-up (10min): Cardio → arm circles → band pull-aparts → scapular push-ups
2. Compounds (30min): Bench press 4x8 → Incline DB press 3x10-12 → DB shoulder press 3x10
3. Accessories (12min): Machine chest press 3x12-15
4. Isolation (15min): Lateral raises 3x15-20 → Overhead triceps extension 3x12-15
5. Cooldown (5min): Static stretching (chest, shoulders, triceps)

**Key features**:
- Bench press is main strength movement (4 sets, lowest reps)
- Incline press targets upper chest (different angle)
- Machine chest press allows pushing without stability demands (can focus on contraction)
- Lateral raises target side delts (higher reps for metabolic stress)
- Triceps work is accessory volume (pre-fatigued from pressing)

### Tuesday: Pull (Back & Biceps)
**Volume**: 14-16 sets back, 8-10 biceps  
**Duration**: ~70min

**Flow**:
1. Warm-up (10min): Cardio (rowing ideal) → band pull-aparts → scapular retractions → light deadlift (bar or 95lbs)
2. Compounds (35min): Deadlift 4x6 → Pull-ups 4x8-10 → Barbell row 3x10-12
3. Accessories (15min): Single-arm DB row 3x12/arm → Face pulls 3x15-20
4. Isolation (12min): Barbell curls 3x10-12 → Hammer curls 3x12-15
5. Cooldown (5min): Static stretching (lats, biceps, forearms)

**Key features**:
- Deadlift is main posterior chain movement (4 sets, long rest 2-3min)
- Pull-ups (or lat pulldown) for back width (vertical pulling)
- Barbell row for back thickness (horizontal pulling)
- Single-arm DB row allows unilateral work (address imbalances, full ROM)
- Face pulls for rear delt health (balance pressing volume from Monday)
- Biceps work: Barbell curls (mass builder) + Hammer curls (brachialis, complements barbell)

### Wednesday: Legs (Quad Emphasis)
**Volume**: 14-16 sets quads, 6-8 hamstrings/glutes, 4-6 calves  
**Duration**: ~75min

**Flow**:
1. Warm-up (10min): Cardio (bike ideal) → leg swings → bodyweight squats → ankle mobility
2. Compounds (40min): Back squat 4x8 (tempo: 3-1-X) → Leg press 3x12-15 → Bulgarian split squat 3x10/leg
3. Isolation (15min): Leg extensions 3x15-20 → Leg curls 3x15
4. Accessories (12min): RDL 3x12 → Calf raises 4x15-20
5. Cooldown (10min): Static stretching (quads, hamstrings, hip flexors) + optional foam rolling

**Key features**:
- Back squat with tempo emphasis (3sec descent, 1sec pause, explosive up) — teaches control in accumulation
- Leg press for high volume quad work (can push harder without stability demands)
- Bulgarian split squat for unilateral work (address imbalances, quad/glute involvement)
- Leg extensions for quad isolation (high reps, metabolic stress)
- RDL for hamstring stretch and load (complements Monday's deadlift)
- Calf raises (4 sets vs 3 on other exercises — calves need more volume)
- Optional foam rolling (legs accumulate fatigue from high volume)

## Volume Distribution

### Per-Muscle Weekly Volume (Week 1 only)
Since Week 1 is the first half of the PPL split (Mon/Tue/Wed), full weekly volume requires Thursday/Friday/Saturday (second Push/Pull/Legs cycle):

**First 3 days volume**:
- **Chest**: 13 sets (Mon: bench 4 + incline DB 3 + machine 3 + shoulder press involves chest 3)
- **Shoulders**: 9 sets (Mon: shoulder press 3 + lateral raises 3 + bench/incline involves front delts 3)
- **Triceps**: 7 sets (Mon: overhead extension 3 + pressing involves triceps 4)
- **Back**: 14 sets (Tue: deadlift 4 + pull-ups 4 + barbell row 3 + single-arm row 3)
- **Biceps**: 9 sets (Tue: barbell curls 3 + hammer curls 3 + pulling involves biceps 3)
- **Quads**: 13 sets (Wed: squat 4 + leg press 3 + Bulgarian split squat 3 + leg extensions 3)
- **Hamstrings**: 6 sets (Wed: RDL 3 + leg curls 3)
- **Calves**: 4 sets (Wed: calf raises 4)

**Full week** (adding Thu/Fri/Sat) would double most of these volumes (PPL × 2).

## Tracking & Progression Emphasis

Unlike beginner workouts (tracking introduced Week 5), intermediate workouts emphasize tracking from Day 1:

**Explicit tracking instructions**:
- Monday: "Record all weights and reps — you'll use this to track progression through Weeks 2-6"
- Monday (bench press): "Track weight used"
- Tuesday (deadlift): "Track weight"
- Wednesday (squat): "Track weight"

**Why tracking matters in accumulation**:
- Need baseline data to add weight in Weeks 2-6
- Accumulation phase adds volume gradually (1-2 sets every 2 weeks)
- Knowing Week 1 weights = knowing when to progress

## Rest Periods

Rest periods vary by exercise category (unlike beginner's uniform 60-90s):

| Category | Rest | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **Deadlift/Squat** | 2-3min | Heavy compounds, high neural demand, need full recovery |
| **Other compounds** | 90-120s | Moderate compounds (bench, pull-ups, leg press), partial recovery |
| **Accessories** | 60-90s | Moderate weight, shorter rest maintains work density |
| **Isolation** | 60s | Light weight, metabolic stress focus, short rest enhances pump |

## Tempo Cues

**Wednesday (Squat)**: 3-1-X tempo  
- 3sec descent (eccentric control)
- 1sec pause at bottom (stability, eliminate bounce)
- X = explosive up (concentric speed)

**Why tempo in accumulation**:
- Teaches control under load (foundation for intensification phase)
- Increases time under tension (hypertrophy stimulus)
- Prevents ego lifting (can't rush with 3sec descent)

**Other movements**: No explicit tempo, but execution notes emphasize control (e.g., "control the descent", "3sec negative on leg extensions")

## Alternatives Provided

Each workout includes alternatives for accessibility and equipment availability:

**Monday**:
- Machine chest press OR Dips 3x12-15 (dips are advanced — use assistance if needed)
- Overhead triceps extension OR Skull crushers 3x12-15

**Tuesday**:
- Pull-ups OR Lat pulldown 4x8-10 (use if can't hit 8-10 pull-ups)
- Barbell row OR Chest-supported row 3x10-12 (chest-supported removes lower back fatigue from deadlift)

**Wednesday**:
- No major alternatives (squat, leg press, Bulgarian split squats are foundational)

## Schema Compliance

Each workout follows `WorkoutStructureLLMSchema`:

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  metadata: {
    title, weekNumber, dayOfWeek, planId, phase, focus, keyFeatures[];
  };
  structuredWorkout: {
    title, focus, description, quote,
    sections: [
      { title, overview, exercises: [ ... ] }
    ],
    estimatedDurationMin, intensityLevel, tags: { ... }
  };
}
```

## Tags Structure

Each workout includes comprehensive tags:

**Category**: `["hypertrophy", "intermediate"]`  
**Split**: `["push"]`, `["pull"]`, or `["legs"]`  
**Muscles**: Primary and secondary muscles worked  
**Patterns**: Movement patterns (horizontal_press, vertical_pull, squat, hinge, lunge)  
**Equipment**: All equipment used (barbell, dumbbell, machine, cable, band, etc.)

## Quality Standards

High-quality intermediate workout:generate examples demonstrate:
- ✅ PPL split structure (Push/Pull/Legs vs full body)
- ✅ Volume appropriate for intermediate (12-16 sets/muscle vs beginner's 4-6)
- ✅ Exercise categorization (Compounds → Accessories → Isolation)
- ✅ Varied rest periods (2-3min heavy compounds → 60s isolation)
