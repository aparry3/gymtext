# Workout:Generate Examples — Intermediate Week 7 DELOAD (Thu, Fri, Sat)

## Purpose
These examples demonstrate how the `workout:generate` agent should structure **deload workouts** for intermediate-level trainees following the "Intermediate — Hypertrophy Focus" plan during Week 7 (Deload phase).

## Week Context
**Plan**: Intermediate — Hypertrophy Focus  
**Week**: 7 (of 16)  
**Phase**: Deload (Weeks 7-8)  
**Goal**: Dissipate 6 weeks of accumulated fatigue through active recovery  
**Intensity**: RPE 6-7 (leave 3-4 reps in reserve)  
**Volume**: 50% reduction (cut all sets in half)  
**Load**: 70-80% of Week 6 working weights

## Workout Selection Rationale
Thursday, Friday, Saturday represent the second half of Week 7's PPL split (completing the 6-day cycle):

- **Thursday (Day 4)**: Push — Triceps & Front Delts (DELOAD)
- **Friday (Day 5)**: Pull — Rear Delts & Biceps (DELOAD)
- **Saturday (Day 6)**: Legs — Hamstring & Glute Emphasis (DELOAD)

These three days showcase:
1. **Deload programming principles** (50% volume, 70-80% loads, RPE 6-7)
2. **Active recovery execution** (same exercises, lighter and shorter)
3. **Session time reduction** (~40-50min vs 60-75min)
4. **Mental framing** ("active recovery, not coasting")

## Deload Programming Principles

### What Is a Deload?
A **scheduled reduction in training stress** to allow the body to recover from accumulated fatigue while maintaining movement patterns and training frequency. Deloads are NOT:
- ❌ Skipping the gym
- ❌ Complete rest (that's a rest week)
- ❌ "Going easy" without structure
- ❌ A sign of weakness

Deloads ARE:
- ✅ **Active recovery** with intentional load/volume reduction
- ✅ **Fatigue dissipation** (muscular, neural, joint stress)
- ✅ **Adaptation opportunity** (super-compensation happens during recovery)
- ✅ **Mental reset** before intensification phase

### Week 7 Deload Parameters

| Parameter | Accumulation (Weeks 1-6) | Deload (Week 7) | Change |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Sets** | 3-4 per exercise | 2 per exercise | **-50%** |
| **Load** | 100% working weight | 70-80% working weight | **-20-30%** |
| **Intensity** | RPE 7-8 (leave 2-3 RIR) | RPE 6-7 (leave 3-4 RIR) | **-1 RPE** |
| **Reps** | Same ranges | **Same ranges** | No change |
| **Exercises** | All movements | **Same movements** | No change |
| **Frequency** | 6 days/week | **6 days/week** | No change |
| **Rest** | 90-120s compounds | 90s compounds | Slightly shorter |
| **Session time** | 65-75min | **40-50min** | -25-30min |

**Key insight**: Deloads maintain exercise selection and frequency but reduce stress through volume and intensity reduction.

### Why 50% Volume?
Research shows:
- **<30% volume reduction**: Insufficient recovery stimulus
- **30-50% volume reduction**: Optimal fatigue dissipation while maintaining adaptations
- **>60% volume reduction**: Risk of detraining (losing accumulated adaptations)

**50% is the sweet spot**: Enough reduction to recover, not so much that you lose fitness.

### Why 70-80% Load?
- **<60% load**: Feels too light, risks mental disengagement
- **60-70% load**: Technique practice range
- **70-80% load**: Light enough to recover, heavy enough to maintain neural adaptations
- **>85% load**: Defeats the purpose (neural fatigue persists)

**70-80% maintains movement quality** without excessive neural demand.

## Workout-by-Workout Breakdown

### Thursday: Push (Triceps & Front Delts DELOAD)
**Volume**: 10 sets total (vs 20 sets in accumulation)  
**Duration**: ~45min (vs 65min)

**Flow**:
1. Warm-up (10min): Cardio → arm circles → band pull-aparts (reduced warm-up)
2. Compounds (20min): Incline BB press 2x8-10 → Flat DB press 2x10-12 → Seated DB shoulder press 2x10-12 → Close-grip bench 2x10-12
3. Isolation (10min): Cable flyes 2x12-15 → Front raises 2x12-15 → Triceps pushdowns 2x15-20
4. Cooldown (5min): Static stretching

**Comparison to Week 1 (Accumulation)**:
- Incline BB press: 4 sets → **2 sets** (50% reduction)
- Flat DB press: 3 sets → **2 sets** (50% reduction)
- Load example: If Week 6 incline press was 155lbs, use **115-125lbs** (70-80%)
- RPE: 7-8 → **6-7** (leave 3-4 reps in reserve, not 2-3)

**Key features**:
- Same exercises (no new movements during deload)
- Lighter loads with execution notes (e.g., "Should feel crisp and controlled")
- Shorter rest (90s compounds vs 90-120s)
- Mental framing: "You should feel strong and controlled, not fatigued"

### Friday: Pull (Rear Delts & Biceps DELOAD)
**Volume**: 10 sets total (vs 20 sets in accumulation)  
**Duration**: ~45min (vs 70min)

**Flow**:
1. Warm-up (10min): Cardio (rowing ideal) → band pull-aparts → scapular retractions
2. Compounds (18min): Weighted pull-ups 2x8-10 → T-bar row 2x10-12 → Seated cable row 2x12-15
3. Isolation (12min): Straight-arm pulldown 2x15 → Reverse pec deck 2x15-20 → Incline DB curls 2x12 → Cable curls 2x15-20
4. Cooldown (5min): Static stretching

**Comparison to Week 1 (Accumulation)**:
- Pull-ups: 4 sets → **2 sets**
- T-bar row: 3 sets → **2 sets**
- Rear delt flyes: 4 sets → **2 sets**
- **NO DEADLIFT** (posterior chain gets extra rest)

**Key features**:
- Deadlift omitted (heaviest compound gets full week rest)
- "Focus on quality reps—smooth and controlled"
- All movements feel easier: "Should feel like a pump, not a burn"
- Alternatives provided (lat pulldown vs pull-ups, Pendlay row vs T-bar)

### Saturday: Legs (Hamstring & Glute DELOAD)
**Volume**: 8 sets total (vs 18 sets in accumulation)  
**Duration**: ~45min (vs 75min)

**Flow**:
1. Warm-up (10min): Cardio → hip mobility → glute activation
2. Compounds (20min): RDL 2x10 → Hip thrusts 2x12-15 → Walking lunges 2x12/leg
3. Isolation (10min): Lying leg curls 2x12-15 → Leg press (narrow stance) 2x15 → Seated calf raises 2x15-20
4. Cooldown (5min): Static stretching

**Comparison to Week 1 (Accumulation)**:
- RDL: 4 sets → **2 sets**
- Load example: If Week 6 RDL was 185lbs, use **135-155lbs** (70-80%)
- **NO SQUAT** (legs get extra rest after Wednesday's squat deload)
- Rest: 2min RDL (vs 2-3min), 90s accessories

**Key features**:
- No heavy squatting (Wednesday already covered quad deload)
- Focus on hamstring/glute with lighter loads
- "Legs should feel fresh—no heavy soreness or joint stress"
- Completes Week 7: "You should feel significantly fresher than Week 6"

## Volume Comparison: Accumulation vs. Deload

### Thursday (Push)
| Exercise | Accumulation (W1) | Deload (W7) | Reduction |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Incline BB Press | 4 sets | **2 sets** | -50% |
| Flat DB Press | 3 sets | **2 sets** | -33% (rounds to -50%) |
| Cable Flyes | 3 sets | **2 sets** | -33% |
| Seated DB Shoulder Press | 3 sets | **2 sets** | -33% |
| Front Raises | 3 sets | **2 sets** | -33% |
| Close-Grip Bench | 3 sets | **2 sets** | -33% |
| Triceps Pushdowns | 3 sets | **2 sets** | -33% |
| **Total** | **22 sets** | **14 sets** | **-36%** |

**Note**: Slightly less than 50% reduction because some exercises started at 3 sets (3→2 is -33%, not -50%). The principle is "cut sets in half" which means 4→2, 3→2 (closest integer).

### Friday (Pull)
| Exercise | Accumulation (W1) | Deload (W7) | Reduction |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Deadlift | 4 sets | **OMITTED** | -100% |
| Pull-ups | 4 sets | **2 sets** | -50% |
| T-Bar Row | 3 sets | **2 sets** | -33% |
| Seated Cable Row | 3 sets | **2 sets** | -33% |
| Straight-Arm Pulldown | 3 sets | **2 sets** | -33% |
| Reverse Pec Deck | 4 sets | **2 sets** | -50% |
| Incline DB Curls | 3 sets | **2 sets** | -33% |
| Cable Curls | 3 sets | **2 sets** | -33% |
| **Total** | **27 sets** | **14 sets** | **-48%** |

**Note**: Deadlift omitted entirely (posterior chain gets full week rest). Other exercises follow 50% rule.

### Saturday (Legs)
| Exercise | Accumulation (W1) | Deload (W7) | Reduction |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Squat | 4 sets | **OMITTED** | -100% (covered Wed) |
| RDL | 4 sets | **2 sets** | -50% |
| Hip Thrusts | 4 sets | **2 sets** | -50% |
| Walking Lunges | 3 sets | **2 sets** | -33% |
| Leg Curls | 3 sets | **2 sets** | -33% |
| Leg Press | 3 sets | **2 sets** | -33% |
| Calf Raises | 4 sets | **2 sets** | -50% |
| **Total** | **25 sets** | **12 sets** | **-52%** |

**Note**: Squat omitted (Wednesday already deloaded quads). Saturday focuses on hamstring/glute with lighter loads.

## Load Reduction Examples

### Thursday: Incline Barbell Press
- **Week 6 (last accumulation week)**: 155lbs × 4 sets × 8-10 reps @ RPE 7-8
- **Week 7 (deload)**: **115-125lbs** × 2 sets × 8-10 reps @ RPE 6-7
- **Load reduction**: -20-26% (70-80% of Week 6)
- **Execution notes**: "Light and crisp... smooth reps, no grinding"

### Friday: RDL
- **Week 6**: 185lbs × 4 sets × 10 reps @ RPE 7-8
- **Week 7**: **135-155lbs** × 2 sets × 10 reps @ RPE 6-7
- **Load reduction**: -16-27% (70-84% of Week 6)
- **Execution notes**: "Focus on hamstring stretch and control... no grinding"

### Saturday: Hip Thrusts
- **Week 6**: 225lbs × 4 sets × 12-15 reps @ RPE 8
- **Week 7**: **170-180lbs** × 2 sets × 12-15 reps @ RPE 7
- **Load reduction**: -20-24% (75-80% of Week 6)
- **Execution notes**: "Glute activation, not maximal load... should feel easy"

## Mental Framing & Execution Notes

Deload workouts include specific language to combat "guilt" about lifting lighter:

**Thursday**:
- "This is ACTIVE recovery—don't skip the gym, but don't push hard either"
- "You should feel strong and controlled, not fatigued"
- "Should feel crisp and controlled"
- "This should feel restorative, not taxing"

**Friday**:
- "Focus on quality reps—smooth and controlled"
- "Should feel like a pump, not a burn"
- "Keep it easy—conversational pace throughout"

**Saturday**:
- "Legs should feel fresh—no heavy soreness or joint stress"
- "This completes your deload week—you should feel significantly fresher than Week 6"
- "Focus on hamstring stretch and glute activation—not maximal load"

**Purpose**: Educate trainees that deloads are intentional, structured recovery—not weakness or laziness.

## Session Time Reduction

| Day | Accumulation (W1) | Deload (W7) | Time Saved |
|-----|-------------------|-------------|------------|
| Thursday | 65min | **45min** | -20min (-31%) |
| Friday | 70min | **45min** | -25min (-36%) |
| Saturday | 75min | **45min** | -30min (-40%) |

**Why shorter**:
- 50% fewer sets = less work time
- Shorter rest periods (90s compounds vs 90-120s)
- Reduced warm-up (1 set mobility vs 2 sets)
- No extended exercises (deadlift/squat omitted Friday/Saturday)

**Benefit**: Extra 20-30min for recovery, sleep, life stress management.

## Exercise Omissions (Strategic)

### Friday: NO Deadlift
**Why**: Deadlift is the most taxing exercise in the program (neural demand, posterior chain fatigue). Omitting it during deload week gives the CNS and lower back full recovery.

**Accumulation**: Deadlift 4x6 @ RPE 7-8  
**Deload**: **OMITTED** (posterior chain rests entirely)

### Saturday: NO Squat
**Why**: Wednesday already deloaded squats (2 sets vs 4 sets). Saturday's focus is hamstring/glute, so no need to repeat quad-dominant work.

**Accumulation**: Squat 4x8 @ RPE 7-8  
**Deload**: **OMITTED** (quads covered Wednesday)

**Result**: Legs get double recovery—Wednesday light squats, Saturday no squats.

## Key Differences: Accumulation vs. Deload

| Dimension | Accumulation (W1) | Deload (W7) | Change |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| **Sets per exercise** | 3-4 | **2** | -50% avg |
| **Total sets per session** | 20-27 | **12-14** | -48-52% |
| **Load** | 100% working weight | **70-80%** | -20-30% |
| **Intensity** | RPE 7-8 | **RPE 6-7** | -1 RPE |
| **Reps** | 6-20 (varies) | **Same ranges** | No change |
| **Rest (compounds)** | 90-120s | **90s** | Slightly shorter |
| **Rest (isolation)** | 60s | **60s** | No change |
| **Session time** | 65-75min | **40-50min** | -25-30min |
| **Heavy compounds** | All included | **Some omitted** | Deadlift/squat strategic rest |
| **Warm-up** | 2 sets mobility | **1 set mobility** | Reduced |
| **Mental framing** | "Track weights, progress" | **"Active recovery, feel fresh"** | Educational |
| **Soreness expected** | Mild | **Minimal to none** | Recovery focus |

## Usage

### For Agent Training
Use these examples to teach `workout:generate` agent:
1. **How to structure deload workouts** (50% volume, 70-80% loads, RPE 6-7)
2. **How to maintain exercise selection** (same movements, just lighter/shorter)
3. **How to frame deloads mentally** ("active recovery, not coasting")
4. **When to omit heavy compounds** (deadlift Friday, squat Saturday)
5. **How to reduce session time** (fewer sets, shorter rest, reduced warm-up)
6. **How to write execution notes for deloads** ("should feel easy", "no grinding")

### For Evaluation
Compare generated deload workouts against these references for:
- **Volume reduction accuracy**: 50% (2 sets vs 4 sets, 2 sets vs 3 sets)
- **Load guidance**: 70-80% of previous working weights with examples
- **Intensity prescription**: RPE 6-7 (leave 3-4 reps in reserve)
- **Exercise selection**: Same movements as accumulation weeks (no new exercises)
- **Heavy compound omissions**: Deadlift omitted Friday, squat omitted Saturday
- **Session time**: 40-50min realistic estimate (vs 65-75min accumulation)
- **Mental framing**: Educational notes about active recovery, no guilt
- **Execution notes**: "Should feel easy", "crisp and controlled", "no grinding"

## Quality Standards

High-quality deload workout:generate examples demonstrate:
- ✅ 50% volume reduction (sets cut in half)
- ✅ 70-80% load reduction with specific examples (e.g., "155lbs → 115-125lbs")
- ✅ RPE 6-7 (leave 3-4 reps in reserve)
- ✅ Same exercises as accumulation (no new movements)
- ✅ Strategic heavy compound omissions (deadlift Friday, squat Saturday)
- ✅ Reduced session time (40-50min vs 65-75min)
- ✅ Mental framing ("active recovery, not coasting")
- ✅ Execution notes emphasizing ease ("should feel easy", "no grinding")
- ✅ Educational language (corrects guilt about lifting lighter)

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid these in deload workouts:
- ❌ Too little volume reduction (<30%) — insufficient recovery
- ❌ Too much volume reduction (>60%) — risks detraining
- ❌ New exercises (stick to familiar movements)
- ❌ Missing load guidance (must specify 70-80% of Week 6)
- ❌ RPE too high (>7 defeats the purpose)
- ❌ Including ALL heavy compounds (deadlift/squat should be omitted or reduced)
- ❌ Same session time (should be 40-50min, not 65-75min)
- ❌ Missing mental framing (trainees need education on why deloads matter)
- ❌ Execution notes emphasizing intensity ("push hard") — wrong message

---

These examples demonstrate professional deload programming: proper volume/load reduction, strategic exercise omissions, mental framing, and educational execution notes. Use them as the gold standard for intermediate deload `workout:generate` outputs.
