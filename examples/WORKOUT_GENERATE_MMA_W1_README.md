# Workout Generate Examples — MMA Week 1

This file contains **workout:generate** agent output examples for MMA Fighter Week 1 (Strength Emphasis phase).

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how the `workout:generate` agent should create structured S&C workouts for fight camp concurrent training. Each workout shows the agent's ability to:

- Structure Olympic lift-based explosive sessions
- Integrate fight-specific conditioning (alactic sprints, fight simulation)
- Provide detailed technical execution notes for complex movements
- Balance CNS-demanding exercises with appropriate rest
- Communicate fighter-specific transfer (takedowns, scrambles, punching power)
- Include bar speed monitoring and auto-regulation cues
- Consider MMA training integration and interference management

## Week 1 Context

**Phase:** Strength Emphasis (Weeks 1-3)  
**Goals:** Build baseline strength capacity (4x5 @ 80-85% 1RM), introduce alactic conditioning, establish movement quality  
**Intensity:** RPE 7-8 (controlled), leave 2-3 reps in reserve  
**Sparring:** 60-85% effort across the week

## Workouts Included

### Monday: Lower Body Power + Alactic Conditioning
- **Duration:** ~60min
- **Focus:** Explosive lower body development and sprint capacity
- **Key Exercises:** Trap Bar Jumps (neural activation), Trap Bar Deadlift (4x5 @ 80%), KB Swings, Broad Jumps, Alactic Sprints (6 rounds x 10sec/50sec)
- **MMA Integration:** Pair with light technical MMA work, avoid heavy sparring

### Wednesday: Upper Body Strength + Anti-Rotation Core
- **Duration:** ~60min
- **Focus:** Punching power and grappling strength
- **Key Exercises:** Landmine Press (4x5 @ 82%, shoulder-safe), Weighted Pull-ups (4x5), Med Ball Rotational Throws, Pallof Press, Dead Hangs (3x45sec grip work)
- **MMA Integration:** Pair with striking-focused MMA (technical, not hard sparring)

### Friday: Full Body Explosive + Fight Simulation Conditioning
- **Duration:** ~60min
- **Focus:** Power integration and fight-specific conditioning
- **Key Exercises:** Hang Power Clean (5x3 @ 72%), Plyo Push-ups, Jump Squats, Fight Simulation Circuits (2 rounds x 5min), Turkish Get-Ups
- **MMA Integration:** Schedule before/after light technique—NOT after hard sparring

## Exercise Selection Rationale

### Trap Bar Over Conventional Deadlift
- **Safety:** Reduced spinal loading vs. conventional (neutral spine easier to maintain)
- **Explosiveness:** Trap bar allows more explosive intent (less technical complexity)
- **Fighter-Specific:** Builds takedown power, scramble strength, positional control

### Landmine Press Over Strict Overhead Press
- **Shoulder Safety:** Angled press path reduces impingement risk (injury history consideration)
- **Unilateral:** Single-arm variation trains stability + anti-rotation core
- **Fighter-Specific:** Unilateral pressing builds punching power and core engagement

### Hang Power Clean (Not Full Clean)
- **Technical:** Power position (quarter-squat catch) simpler than full squat clean
- **Speed Emphasis:** Power variants prioritize bar speed over load
- **Fighter-Specific:** Explosive triple extension = takedown/sprawl power

### Med Ball Throws Over Cable Rotations
- **Velocity:** Throwing allows max-velocity rotation (cables limit speed)
- **Fighter-Specific:** Matches punching mechanic (explosive hip rotation)

### Dead Hangs (Grip Priority)
- **Grappling-Critical:** Grip endurance = grappling endurance
- **Time Under Tension:** 45sec holds build capacity (not just strength)
- **Fighter-Specific:** Maintaining grips in late rounds, top control, clinch work

## Bar Speed Monitoring

All max strength and power exercises include bar speed guidance:

**Trap Bar Deadlift (Monday):**
> "If rep slows significantly (>3sec grind), reduce load 5-10lbs."

**Landmine Press (Wednesday):**
> "If press slows to grind, reduce load."

**Hang Power Clean (Friday):**
> "Bar speed is THE quality metric. If bar doesn't accelerate explosively, reduce load immediately."

**Purpose:** Prioritize quality (speed, technique) over absolute load. Week 1 is foundation—don't chase PRs.

## Fight-Specific Conditioning

### Alactic Conditioning (Monday)
- **Structure:** 6 rounds x 10sec sprint / 50sec rest
- **Work-to-Rest:** 1:5 ratio (alactic system recovery, no lactate)
- **Purpose:** Explosive bursts without fatigue (takedown attempts, scrambles)
- **Modalities:** Assault Bike, hill sprints, rowing machine

### Fight Simulation Circuits (Friday)
- **Structure:** 2 rounds x 5min work / 1min rest
- **Circuit:** 30sec Assault Bike → 30sec KB Swings → 30sec Burpees → 30sec Battle Ropes (repeat 2x per round)
- **Purpose:** Multi-modal conditioning matching fight structure
- **Intensity:** Should feel like you went 2 rounds

## MMA Integration Guidance

### Monday (Lower Power)
> "Pair with light technical MMA work or schedule on grappling-light day. Avoid heavy sparring immediately after—lower body will be fatigued."

### Wednesday (Upper Strength)
> "Pair with striking-focused MMA session (technical, not hard sparring). Shoulder fatigue from pressing makes hard sparring riskier."

### Friday (Explosive + Fight Sim)
> "Schedule CAREFULLY. High-CNS-demand session. Pair with light technique OR schedule 4-6hr before/after MMA. Do NOT schedule after hard sparring."

**Philosophy:** S&C serves MMA training, not the other way around. If you must choose between quality S&C and quality sparring, choose sparring.

## Technical Execution Notes

Each exercise includes detailed setup and execution notes:

### Example: Hang Power Clean (Friday)
```
Setup: Bar at mid-thigh (hang position), grip just outside shoulders, 
flat back, shoulders over bar.

Execution: Small dip (load hamstrings), EXPLODE up—shrug, pull elbows high, 
drop under bar, catch in quarter-squat (power position, not full clean). 
Stand to full extension.

Bar Speed: This is THE quality metric. If bar doesn't accelerate explosively, 
reduce load. Don't grind Olympic lifts—they're speed work, not max effort.

Technique Notes: Triple extension = ankles + knees + hips extend simultaneously 
(full body explosion). Catch should be aggressive—pull yourself under bar, 
don't wait for it to fall.

Purpose: Full-body explosive power, rate of force development, power endurance.

Fighter-specific: Explosive takedowns, sprawl power, scramble speed, level changes.
```

## Comparison: General Population vs. MMA

### General Population (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
- **Exercise Selection:** Gym-standard (bench press, back squat, conventional deadlift)
- **Conditioning:** Optional cardio or HIIT (not fight-specific)
- **Notes:** Form cues, progression rules, muscle groups targeted
- **Purpose:** Hypertrophy, strength, aesthetics, health

### MMA Fighter (Sport-Specific)
- **Exercise Selection:** Transfer-optimized (trap bar for safety + explosiveness, landmine for shoulder health)
- **Conditioning:** Fight simulation circuits, alactic sprints (matches sport demands)
- **Notes:** Fighter-specific transfer (takedowns, scrambles, punching power), bar speed monitoring, MMA integration guidance
- **Purpose:** Fight performance, power development, maintaining strength while prioritizing technical training

## Use Cases

1. **Agent Training:** Train `workout:generate` agent on sport-specific S&C programming with Olympic lifts, fight conditioning, and concurrent training integration
2. **Agent Evaluation:** Validate technical execution notes, fighter-specific transfer communication, MMA integration guidance
3. **Database Seeding:** Seed MMA S&C workout templates
4. **Athlete Education:** Show fighters what quality S&C programming looks like (not just "lift heavy and run")
5. **Coach Reference:** Demonstrate concurrent training programming (S&C that serves MMA, not competes with it)
