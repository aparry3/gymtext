# Workout Generate Examples — MMA Week 4

This file contains **workout:generate** agent output examples for MMA Fighter Week 4 (Power Development phase).

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how the `workout:generate` agent should create peak-demand S&C workouts during the Power Development phase. Each workout shows the agent's ability to:

- Reduce strength volume while increasing intensity (3x3 @ 87% vs Week 1's 4x5 @ 80%)
- Increase explosive work volume (4-5 sets vs 3 sets in Week 1)
- Provide detailed auto-regulation cues for peak training demand
- Emphasize bar speed monitoring as fatigue accumulates
- Include recovery protocols for highest-demand week
- Communicate power transfer to striking/grappling performance

## Week 4 Context

**Phase:** Power Development (Weeks 4-5)  
**Goals:** Convert accumulated strength into explosive power, peak conditioning volume, test power transfer  
**Intensity:** RPE 8-9 (high), leave 1-2 reps in reserve  
**Sparring:** 75-90% effort (test power transfer, 2-3 comp-pace rounds)  
**Key Principle:** "Most demanding week of camp—manage fatigue carefully"

### Key Observations

**Inverse Volume/Intensity:**
- Strength work: 40% volume reduction, 6-9% intensity increase
- Explosive work: 25-33% volume increase
- Conditioning: 25-50% volume increase

**Total Training Demand:**
- Week 1: Moderate (foundation building)
- Week 4: PEAK (most demanding week of camp)

## Exercise Substitution Rationale

### Monday: Box Jumps (vs Week 1 Trap Bar Jumps)
**Why:** Max height emphasis (vs max intent), vertical power development, landing mechanics focus  
**Fighter-Specific:** Vertical power for scrambles, landing control after throws/sweeps

### Monday: Safety Bar Squat (vs Week 1 Trap Bar Deadlift)
**Why:** Higher-intensity squatting with less low-back stress, cambered bar keeps torso upright  
**Fighter-Specific:** Explosive squat strength for level changes, takedown defense, cage pressure  
**Safety:** If first rep feels slow/grindy, reduce load immediately

### Monday: Lateral Bounds (vs Week 1 Broad Jumps)
**Why:** MMA-specific footwork (lateral movement), single-leg stability, angle changes  
**Fighter-Specific:** Cage cutting, angle creation for striking, lateral scramble movement  
**Progression:** Emphasizes fight-specific movement patterns

### Wednesday: Barbell Bench (vs Week 1 Landmine Press)
**Why:** Bilateral heavy loading, higher absolute strength development  
**Fighter-Specific:** Pressing strength for clinch work, pushing through guard  
**Tradeoff:** Less shoulder-safe than landmine—if shoulders feel tweaky, revert to landmine or reduce load

### Friday: Power Clean (vs Week 1 Hang Clean)
**Why:** Full ROM from floor (vs hang position), higher technical demand, slightly heavier loads possible  
**Fighter-Specific:** Full-body explosive power, complete triple extension  
**Safety:** Higher technical demand—if form breaks, reduce load or revert to hang clean

### Friday: Med Ball Chest Pass (vs Week 1 Plyo Push-ups)
**Why:** Allows heavier load, more specific horizontal pressing pattern  
**Fighter-Specific:** Pushing power in clinch, pressing off opponent, explosive hand extension  
**Progression:** Plyometric → ballistic with external load

### Friday: Jump Squats with Load (vs Week 1 Bodyweight)
**Why:** 10-20% bodyweight load increases power output, tests power expression under load  
**Fighter-Specific:** Loaded explosive movement (like opponent on back during scramble)  
**Safety:** Landing mechanics critical—if awkward, drop load

## Bar Speed Monitoring Evolution

### Week 1 (Baseline):
> "If bar speed slows significantly, reduce load 5-10lbs."

### Week 4 (Quantitative):
> "If bar slows (grind >3sec), reduce load 5-10lbs immediately."

> "If first rep feels slow/grindy, reduce load immediately."

> "Bar speed is THE quality metric. If bar doesn't accelerate explosively, you're using too much weight."

**Purpose:** As fatigue accumulates (Week 4 peak demand), bar speed monitoring becomes more precise to prevent injury and maintain power quality.

## Auto-Regulation Guidance

### Monday
> "If overly fatigued from Thursday's sparring (last week), scale back today's volume: reduce to 2x3 squats or 6 alactic rounds."

### Wednesday  
> "If overly fatigued from Tuesday's MMA, scale back: reduce bench to 2x3 or skip battle ropes."

> "Monitor bar speed Fri Olympic lifts. If you're overly fatigued Thu, scale back sparring 1-2 rounds."

### Friday
> "If Thursday sparring was hard, you may be fatigued. Don't force 75% if bar speed is slow—drop to 70-72% and maintain speed."

> "If overly fatigued, scale back: reduce power cleans to 4 sets or drop fight simulation to 2 rounds."

**Philosophy:** Week 4 is peak demand. Listen to your body. Quality > volume. Prioritize Saturday's open mat (highest-volume MMA day).

## Recovery Protocols

### Hydration Evolution

| Session | Week 1 | Week 4 | Increase |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| Monday | 16-24oz | 24oz + electrolytes if MMA <4hr | +33% |
| Wednesday | 16-24oz | 24oz (striking = dehydration risk) | +50% |
| Friday | 24-32oz | 32oz (most demanding session) | +33% |

### Nutrition Guidance

**Week 1:** "Protein within 30min (20-30g), carbs if MMA follows"  
**Week 4:** "Protein + carbs within 30min (25-30g protein, 40-50g carbs). Peak demand—fuel appropriately."

**Optional Calorie Surplus:** "Week 4 is peak demand—calorie surplus if weight allows"

### Recovery Modalities

**All Weeks:**
- Contrast showers (2min hot, 30sec cold, repeat 3x)
- Ice baths (10-15min, lower body)

**Week 4 Specific:**
- Monday: "Consider 10-15min contrast shower or ice bath if MMA <4hr away"
- Wednesday: "Contrast shower (hot/cold) if time allows before MMA"
- Friday: "Consider 15min ice bath if MMA >4hr away. Sleep 8-9hr tonight—Saturday is open mat."

### Sleep Priority

**Week 4 Emphasis:**
- Monday: Standard 8-9hr
- Wednesday: Standard 8-9hr
- Friday: "Sleep 8-9hr tonight—Saturday is highest MMA volume (open mat, 6-8 rounds)"

## Power Transfer Indicators

### Wednesday Notes:
> "Tomorrow (Thursday) is sparring day. You should notice increased snap in punches—that's the rotational power work paying off."

### Friday Notes:
> "This round separates fighters—can you maintain output when fatigued? If you can push through Round 3 with quality, you're building the conditioning to go 3 rounds in a fight."

**Purpose:** Connect S&C work to fight performance. Athletes should FEEL the power transfer in sparring.

## Peak Training Demand Management

### Mental Framing
- Monday: "This is peak training demand week. Intensity is high..."
- Wednesday: "Peak Demand Week: Upper strength at RPE 8-9 throughout..."
- Friday: "Peak explosive and conditioning session... hardest conditioning so far"

### Session Timing Critical
- Monday: "Pair with lighter MMA day to manage fatigue"
- Wednesday: "Pair with striking-focused MMA (technical, NOT hard sparring)"
- Friday: "Schedule CAREFULLY. This is high-CNS-demand session."

### Interference Management
- "Monitor bar speed Fri Olympic lifts. If overly fatigued Thu, scale back sparring 1-2 rounds."
- "If Thursday sparring was hard, you may need to reduce load 5-10lbs."
- "Don't compromise technical training for S&C finishers."

## Quality Standards

- ✅ Volume/intensity progression from Week 1 clearly demonstrated
- ✅ Peak training demand acknowledged upfront in all workouts
- ✅ Quantitative bar speed monitoring ("grind >3sec" vs qualitative)
- ✅ Auto-regulation cues integrated throughout (scale if fatigued)
- ✅ Recovery protocols elevated (higher hydration, nutrition, sleep emphasis)
- ✅ Power transfer communication (notice snap in punches, feel 3 rounds)
- ✅ Exercise substitution rationale (why box jumps vs trap bar jumps, etc.)
- ✅ MMA integration timing more critical (not after hard sparring)
- ✅ Session time realistic (~60min with detailed breakdowns)

## Comparison: Week 1 vs Week 4

### Training Philosophy Shift
**Week 1:** "Build the foundation for power development"  
**Week 4:** "Convert accumulated strength into explosive power. Test power transfer."

### Intensity Guidance
**Week 1:** "RPE 7-8 (controlled), leave 2-3 reps in reserve"  
**Week 4:** "RPE 8-9 (high), leave 1-2 reps in reserve"

### Bar Speed Language
**Week 1:** "If bar speed drops, reduce load"  
**Week 4:** "Bar speed is THE quality metric. If grind >3sec, reduce immediately."

### Recovery Emphasis
**Week 1:** Standard hydration/nutrition guidance  
**Week 4:** Elevated protocols, sleep priority before Saturday open mat, calorie surplus option

### Mental Preparation
**Week 1:** Foundation setting, long-term perspective  
**Week 4:** Peak demand management, power transfer focus, auto-regulation critical
