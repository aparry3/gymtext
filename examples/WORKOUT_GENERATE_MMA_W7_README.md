# Workout Generate Examples: MMA Week 7 (Fight Peak)

## Overview
This file contains 3 detailed workout examples for **MMA Sport-Specific Plan, Week 7 (Fight Peak - Week 2/2)**. Week 7 is the final week of active fight preparation before taper, where all training qualities (strength, power, conditioning) integrate into fight-ready performance. These examples demonstrate how the `workout:generate` agent should create detailed daily workouts with exercise-level specificity, coaching cues, fighter-specific transfer notes, and CNS priming emphasis (not muscle building).

## Week 7 Context: Fight Peak (Week 2/2)

### Phase Characteristics
- **Timing**: Week 7 of 8-week fight camp
- **Goal**: Peak power expression and conditioning capacity while maintaining freshness for fight week taper
- **Training Philosophy**: Quality over quantity—movements should feel FAST and explosive; if anything grinds, reduce load immediately
- **Mental Shift**: You're peaking, not proving. Every session should feel sharp and explosive.

### Programming Principles for Week 7

#### 1. Minimal Volume, Maximum Intent
- **Strength Work**: 2x3 @ 92% 1RM (vs 4x5 @ 80% in Week 1)
  - Purpose: CNS priming, not muscle building
  - Bar speed is THE quality metric
  - If reps grind (>3sec), STOP and reduce load
- **Olympic Lifts**: 4x2 @ 77% 1RM (vs 5x3 @ 72% in Week 1)
  - Reduced volume for freshness
  - Bar speed critical—if any rep is slow, stop set
- **Plyometrics**: 3x3 (vs 3x5 in Week 1)
  - Quality over quantity—every rep should be explosive
  - Perfect landing mechanics prioritized

#### 2. Peak Conditioning Volume
- **Fight Simulation**: 5 rounds x 5min work / 1min rest (vs 2 rounds in Week 1)
  - Replicates full fight structure
  - Rounds 3-5 are where mental toughness is built
  - You should finish feeling like you went 5 rounds
- **Alactic Conditioning**: 6 rounds x 10sec / 50sec (maintained from Week 1, reduced from 8 rounds in Week 4)
  - Freshness emphasis—every sprint should feel FAST

#### 3. Session Duration Reduction
- **Lower/Upper Days**: 50min (vs 60min in Week 1)
  - Reduced rest periods and exercise volume
  - Focus on explosive quality, not fatigue accumulation
- **Friday Full Body**: 60min (maintained for peak conditioning volume)
  - Peak fight simulation conditioning centerpiece

#### 4. Bar Speed as Quality Metric
- **Trap Bar Deadlift**: If any rep slows to grind (>3sec), STOP SET and reduce load 5-10lbs
- **Bench Press**: Bar should move explosively despite 92% load—if it doesn't, reduce immediately
- **Power Clean**: If bar doesn't accelerate explosively, STOP SET—don't grind Olympic lifts
- **Rationale**: You're priming the nervous system, not building strength. Grinding reps = too much fatigue.

#### 5. Freshness Checks
- **Every movement should feel FAST**
- If you feel sluggish, reduce volume or load immediately
- Trust your body—you've done the work over 6 weeks
- When in doubt, skip optional conditioning

## Workout Examples

### 1. Monday: Lower Body Power + Alactic Conditioning (Fight Peak)
**Focus**: Explosive quality and neural freshness

**Key Features**:
- Neural Activation: 3x2 Trap Bar Jumps (reduced from 3x3 in Week 1)
- Max Strength: 2x3 Trap Bar Deadlift @ 92% 1RM (CNS priming, not building)
- Explosive Strength: 3x3 KB Swings (reduced from 3x5 in Week 1)
- Plyometrics: 3x3 Box Jumps (quality emphasis—every rep should be explosive)
- Alactic Conditioning: 6 rounds x 10sec sprint / 50sec rest
- **Session Time**: 50min (reduced from 60min)

**Programming Notes**:
- Bar speed is THE quality metric—if trap bar deadlift grinds, stop immediately
- Only 2 sets of strength work (vs 4 in Week 1)—minimal volume for peak freshness
- Schedule away from hard sparring—pair with light technical MMA work

### 2. Wednesday: Upper Body Strength + Anti-Rotation Core (Fight Peak)
**Focus**: Upper body CNS priming and rotational power

**Key Features**:
- Max Strength Push: 2x3 Bench Press @ 92% 1RM (CNS priming, heavier load than landmine press)
- Max Strength Pull: 2x3 Weighted Pull-ups @ RPE 9 (or Barbell Row @ 90% 1RM)
- Rotational Power: 3x4/side Med Ball Rotational Throws (reduced reps, increased intent)
- Anti-Rotation Core: 3x6/side Pallof Press (heavier resistance, fewer reps)
- Grip Maintenance: 2x45sec Dead Hang (reduced from 3 sets in Week 1)
- **Session Time**: 50min (reduced from 60min)

**Programming Notes**:
- Bench press replaces landmine press for heavier loading and neural priming
- Every movement should feel crisp and explosive
- Skip optional battle ropes conditioning if fatigued—prioritize freshness

### 3. Friday: Full Body Explosive + Fight Simulation Conditioning (Peak)
**Focus**: Maximum power expression and fight-ready conditioning

**Key Features**:
- Olympic Lift: 4x2 Power Clean @ 77% 1RM (reduced volume for freshness)
- Explosive Upper: 3x3 Plyo Push-ups (reduced from 3x5 in Week 1)
- Explosive Lower: 3x3 Jump Squats @ bodyweight (quality emphasis)
- **Fight Simulation: 5 rounds x 5min work / 1min rest (PEAK conditioning volume)**
- Finisher: 1x5/side Turkish Get-Up (reduced from 2x10 in Week 1)
- **Session Time**: 60min (maintained for peak conditioning)

**Programming Notes**:
- This is the HARDEST conditioning session of camp
- Fight simulation replicates full fight structure—you should finish feeling like you went 5 rounds
- Rounds 3-5 are where mental toughness is built for the cage
- Bar speed critical on power cleans—if any rep is slow, stop set
- Schedule away from hard sparring (ideally after light technical work)

## Fight Peak Phase Progression Context

### Week 1 → Week 7 Progression
| Component | Week 1 | Week 7 | Change |

### MMA Training Integration
- **Monday**: Schedule away from hard sparring—pair with light technical work or grappling-light day
- **Wednesday**: Pair with striking-focused MMA session (technical, not hard sparring)
- **Thursday**: Final hard sparring day (4 x 5min @ 85-90% effort)
- **Friday**: Schedule away from hard sparring—ideally after light technique work
- **Saturday**: Final hard MMA day (5-6 rounds sparring @ 75-85% effort)
- **Sunday**: Active recovery / light technical work only

## Key Coaching Cues for Week 7

### Bar Speed Monitoring
- **Trap Bar Deadlift**: \"If rep takes >3sec, STOP SET and reduce load 5-10lbs\"
- **Bench Press**: \"Bar should move fast despite 92% load—if it doesn't, you're doing too much\"
- **Power Clean**: \"If bar doesn't accelerate explosively, STOP SET immediately\"
- **Rationale**: You're priming nervous system, not building strength. Grinding reps = too much fatigue.

### Freshness Checks
- \"Every movement should feel FAST—if you feel sluggish, reduce volume or load\"
- \"When in doubt, skip optional conditioning—prioritize freshness over volume\"
- \"Trust your body—you've done the work over 6 weeks\"
- \"You're peaking, not proving. Save the grind for the cage.\"

### Fight Simulation Intensity
- \"Rounds 1-2 should feel manageable\"
- \"Rounds 3-4 are where mental toughness shows\"
- \"Round 5 is where you dig deep—this is fight conditioning under fatigue\"
- \"You should finish feeling like you just went 5 rounds. If you don't, intensity wasn't high enough.\"

### Recovery Priority
- \"Next week is taper—prioritize sleep (8-9hr), nutrition (maintenance calories, high protein), mental visualization\"
- \"Hydrate aggressively post-session (24-32oz)\"
- \"Protein + carbs within 30min of finishing\"
- \"If MMA session is >4hr away, consider 10-15min ice bath or contrast shower\"

## Fighter-Specific Transfer Notes

### Lower Body (Monday)
