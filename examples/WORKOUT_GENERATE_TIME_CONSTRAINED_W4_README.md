# Time-Constrained Week 4 workout:generate Examples

## Purpose

Reference examples demonstrating the `workout:generate` agent output for **Time-Constrained Week 4** (Progressive Overload Mid-Phase).

These examples show how workouts evolve from Foundation Phase (Week 1) to Progressive Overload Phase (Weeks 3-6), with systematic load and volume increases.

## Context

- **Plan**: Time-Efficient Strength & Conditioning (8 weeks, 30-45min sessions, 3 days/week)
- **Week 4**: Progressive Overload Phase Mid-Point (Weeks 3-6)
- **Phase Goals**: Increase load and volume systematically with 70-75% loads @ RPE 7-8
- **Training Parameters**: Add 5-10lbs to compounds or 1-2 reps per set from Week 3
- **Session Structure**: 3 supersets per workout (optional 4th for advanced), <15sec transitions, 60-90sec rest between
- **Philosophy**: Track everything, compare to Week 3, progressive overload in action

## Week 4 Characteristics

### Progressive Overload Mid-Phase (Weeks 3-6)
- **Primary Goal**: Systematic strength increases through load/volume progression
- **Loads**: 70-75% estimated 1RM (vs 60-65% Week 1)
- **RPE**: 7-8 (leave 2-3 reps in reserve, vs RPE 6-7 / leave 3-4 RIR in Week 1)
- **Session Time**: 35-40min (vs 30-35min Week 1)—extended due to heavier loads requiring longer rest
- **Progression Rule**: If Week 3 felt RPE 7-8, add 5-10lbs to compounds or 1-2 reps to accessories
- **Cardio Finishers**: Still optional (8min vs 5min Week 1), skip if fatigued from work/life stress

### Week 4 Training Days (Flexible Scheduling Demonstrated)
- **Tuesday (Day 1)**: Full Body A — Push Emphasis
- **Thursday (Day 3)**: Full Body B — Pull Emphasis  
- **Saturday (Day 5)**: Full Body C — Lower Emphasis

**Note**: Using Tue/Thu/Sat instead of Mon/Wed/Fri demonstrates the program's flexible scheduling philosophy ("any 3 non-consecutive days"). Week 1 used Mon/Wed/Fri; Week 4 uses Tue/Thu/Sat to show adaptability.

### Progression from Week 1 to Week 4

| Parameter | Week 1 (Foundation) | Week 4 (Progressive Overload) | Change |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------------------|--------|
| **Loads** | 60-65% 1RM | 70-75% 1RM | +15-20% |
| **RPE** | 6-7 (leave 3-4 RIR) | 7-8 (leave 2-3 RIR) | +1 RPE |
| **Session Time** | 30-35min | 35-40min | +5-10min |
| **Focus** | Learn superset technique | Progressive overload (add weight/reps) |
| **Squats** | Goblet Squat | Barbell Back Squat |
| **Deadlifts** | Lighter (form focus) | Heavier (70-75% 1RM) |
| **Plank Duration** | 30-45sec | 45-60sec | +15sec |
| **Cardio Finisher** | 5min | 8min | +3min |
| **Optional 4th Superset** | Not mentioned | Introduced for advanced trainees |

- Optional 4th superset for advanced trainees (if time/energy allows, keep total under 45min)

**Progressive Overload Examples**:
- Squat: "If Week 3 you squatted 135lbs×10 @ RPE 7, this week try 145lbs×10 or 135lbs×12"
- Deadlift: "If Week 3 you pulled 185lbs×8 @ RPE 7, try 205lbs×8 or 185lbs×10"
- Shoulder Press: "If Week 3 you used 30lb dumbbells×10, try 35lb×10 or 30lb×12"
- Plank: "Increase duration from Week 1's 30-45sec; if 60sec is easy, add 10-25lb plate to back"

**Educational Focus**:
- "Track every set—weight, reps completed, RPE"
- "Compare loads to Week 3. Are you lifting 5-10lbs heavier or doing 1-2 more reps per set? Track everything."
- "Optional 4th Superset: only add if you have time and energy—session should stay under 45min including warm-up"

### 2. Thursday (Day 3) — Full Body B: Pull Emphasis
**File ID**: `time-constrained-w4-thursday`

**Workout Structure**:
- **Superset 1**: Barbell Deadlift 3×6-8 (second session this week) + Pull-ups or Lat Pulldown 3×6-10
- **Superset 2**: Goblet Squat or Front Squat 3×10-12 + Dumbbell Bench Press 3×8-10
- **Superset 3**: Dumbbell RDL 3×10-12 + Dumbbell Curls 3×10-12
- **Optional Finisher**: 5 rounds × 10 burpees, 30sec rest (6min total)

**Key Features**:
- Second deadlift session this week (work capacity building without excessive volume per session)
- Pull-ups with added weight or increased reps (if Week 3 you did 8 bodyweight, try +5-10lbs or 10 reps)
- Option to progress from goblet to front squat with barbell
- Loads may be slightly lighter than Tuesday due to accumulated fatigue—that's expected

**Work Capacity Strategy**:
- "Deadlifts twice per week (Tue + Thu) builds work capacity without excessive volume per session"
- "This is your second deadlift session in 3 days. You're building posterior chain strength and technique competency"
- "Loads: If Tuesday you pulled 205lbs×8, today you might pull 195-205lbs depending on fatigue. That's fine—don't chase Tuesday's numbers if you're fatigued"
- "Bar speed is king: if bar moves fast, load is appropriate. If grinding on rep 6, reduce 10lbs"

**Progressive Overload Guidance**:
- Goblet → Front Squat progression: "If Week 3 you used 50lb dumbbell×12, try 55lb×12 or 50lb×15. If progressing to barbell front squat, start conservative (empty bar or 65lbs) to learn pattern"
- Pull-ups: "If Week 3 you did 8 bodyweight reps, try adding weight (5-10lbs via weight belt) and aiming for 6-8 reps, OR aim for 10 bodyweight reps"
- Accessories: "Progressive overload applies to accessories too—add 2.5-5lbs per dumbbell if Week 3 felt easy"

### 3. Saturday (Day 5) — Full Body C: Lower Emphasis
**File ID**: `time-constrained-w4-saturday`

**Workout Structure**:
- **Superset 1**: Front Squat or Barbell Back Squat 3×8-10 + Dumbbell Bench Press 3×8-10
- **Superset 2**: Barbell RDL 3×10-12 + Dumbbell Row (bent-over, both arms) or Barbell Row 3×10/arm
- **Superset 3**: Walking Lunges 3×10-12/leg + Dumbbell Overhead Press 3×8-10
- **Optional Finisher**: 4 rounds × 40-50 yards farmer carries, 90sec rest (8min total)

**Key Features**:
- Squat variation from Tuesday (if Tue was back squat, try front squat here; vice versa)
- Barbell RDL allows heavier loads than dumbbell RDL (bilateral vs unilateral)
- Walking lunges with heavier dumbbells (progressive overload for unilateral work)
- Third pressing session this week (bench Tue/Thu/Sat, overhead press Tue/Thu/Sat)—volume accumulation

**Lower Emphasis Programming**:
- Front Squat: "Bar on front delts, elbows high, stay upright—don't let torso collapse forward"
- Barbell RDL: "Allows heavier loads than dumbbell RDL. If Thursday you used 40lb dumbbells (80lbs total), today you might use 115-135lbs on barbell"
- Walking Lunges: "If Week 3 you used 20lb dumbbells×10/leg, try 25lb×10/leg or 20lb×12/leg today"

**Week 4 Complete Reflection**:
- "Week 4 complete after this session—you've accumulated significant training stress (heavier loads than Week 1-2)"
- "Week 4 reflection: Compare loads to Week 3—did you successfully add 5-10lbs or 1-2 reps across most exercises? That's progressive overload in action"
- "Progressive overload isn't linear—you won't add weight every single week forever. The goal is trend progression (compare Week 4 to Week 1—are you significantly stronger? Yes.)"

## Format Compliance

All examples follow `WorkoutStructureLLMSchema`:
- ✅ `structuredWorkout` field (not `workout`)
- ✅ Omits `id`, `exerciseId`, `nameRaw`, `resolution` fields
- ✅ Uses `intensity` object with `type`, `value`, `description`
- ✅ Includes `supersetId` field (e.g., "S1", "S2", "S3", "S4", "" for non-supersets)
- ✅ Optional fields handled correctly (empty strings for unused fields)

### Superset Tagging
- Superset 1: `"supersetId": "S1"`
- Superset 2: `"supersetId": "S2"`
- Superset 3: `"supersetId": "S3"`
- Optional 4th Superset (Tuesday only): `"supersetId": "S4"`
- Warm-up/cooldown/finishers: `"supersetId": ""`

## Progressive Overload Implementation

### Compound Movement Progression (5-10lbs or 1-2 reps)

**If Week 3 felt RPE 7 (easy):**
- Add 5-10lbs and maintain reps
- Example: Squat 135lbs×10 → 145lbs×10

**If Week 3 felt RPE 8 (appropriate):**
- Maintain weight and add 1-2 reps
- Example: Squat 135lbs×10 → 135lbs×12

**If Week 3 felt RPE 8.5+ (too hard):**
- Reduce weight 5-10% and rebuild
- Example: Squat 155lbs×8 → 145lbs×10

### Accessory Movement Progression (2.5-5lbs or 1-2 reps)

**Dumbbell exercises:**
- Dumbbells jump in 5lb increments (each side)
- If 5lb jump feels too big, add reps instead
- Example RDL: 40lb DBs×12 → 45lb×12 OR 40lb×15

**Volume-based progression:**
- Accessories respond well to volume (adding reps)
- Adding 2 reps can be as effective as adding weight
- Example Curls: 25lb DBs×12 → 30lb×12 OR 25lb×15

### Bodyweight Movement Progression

**Push-ups:**
- Week 1: Bodyweight 8-12 reps
- Week 4: Weighted (backpack with 10-25lbs) 10-15 reps OR elevated feet

**Pull-ups:**
- Week 1: Bodyweight 6-10 reps
- Week 4: Weighted (+5-10lbs via belt) 6-8 reps OR bodyweight 10+ reps

**Plank:**
- Week 1: 30-45sec
- Week 4: 45-60sec OR weighted (10-25lb plate on back)

## Flexible Scheduling Philosophy

### Week 1 vs Week 4 Day Labels
- **Week 1**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday (traditional recommendation)
- **Week 4**: Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday (demonstrates flexibility)

**Why this matters:**
- Shows the program adapts to life schedules
- "Any 3 non-consecutive days" philosophy in action
- Week 1 establishes pattern, Week 4 shows it can shift

### Real-World Flexibility Examples
- **Traditional**: Mon/Wed/Fri
- **Shift Worker**: Tue/Thu/Sat (Week 4 example)
- **Weekend Preference**: Wed/Fri/Sun
- **Downgrade Option**: If life gets busy, can do 2 sessions/week (Day 1 + Day 3, skip Day 5)

## Optional Components

### 4th Superset (Advanced Trainees)
- **Introduced in Week 4** (not present in Week 1)
- **Criteria**: Only add if time/energy allows AND session stays under 45min
- **Structure**: 2 sets (not 3) to keep volume manageable
- **Exercises**: Goblet Squat 2×12-15 + Dumbbell Chest Flyes 2×12-15
- **Purpose**: Additional quad/chest volume for trainees who can handle more

**Implementation Notes**:
- Tuesday only (Day 1)—not on Day 3 or Day 5
- "Only add if you have time and energy—session should stay under 45min including warm-up"
- "This is optional—main 3 supersets are the priority"

### Cardio Finishers
- **Week 1**: 5min finishers (row intervals, jump rope, hill sprints)
- **Week 4**: 8min finishers (assault bike, burpees, farmer carries)
- **Progression**: +60% duration (5min → 8min) but still optional

**Week 4 Finisher Philosophy**:
- "Optional cardio finishers are still available but not required"
- "If you're fatigued from work/life stress, skip them. The main supersets are the priority"
- "If you're feeling run-down or sleep-deprived, consider skipping Friday's cardio finisher"

## Recovery and Fatigue Management

### Increased Recovery Demands
- Heavier loads (70-75% vs 60-65%) require more CNS recovery
- Higher RPE (7-8 vs 6-7) creates more training stress
- Session time extended (35-40min vs 30-35min) due to longer rest needs

### Recovery Guidance (Week 4 Specific)

**Sleep:**
- Week 1: "7-8 hours per night"
- Week 4: "Prioritize sleep—aim for 8 hours if possible"

**Nutrition:**
- Week 1: "Eat at maintenance calories"
- Week 4: "Eat at maintenance or slight surplus (200-300 cal above maintenance to support strength gains)"

**Protein:**
- Week 4: "Prioritize protein (0.8-1g per lb bodyweight)"

**DOMS Management:**
- "Post-Day 1 soreness is normal, especially if you increased loads significantly—don't panic"
- "Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) peaks 24-48hr after training and resolves by Day 3-4"
- "If you're extremely sore, light walking (15-20min) can help flush metabolic waste and reduce stiffness"

### Fatigue Auto-Regulation

**If loads feel heavier than expected:**
- "Loads may be slightly lighter than Tuesday due to accumulated fatigue, and that's fine"
- "Don't chase Tuesday's numbers if you're fatigued"
- "Bar speed is king: if bar moves fast, load is appropriate. If grinding, reduce 10lbs"

**If failed reps 2 sessions in a row:**
- "If you failed to complete reps for 2 consecutive sessions, reduce weight by 10% and rebuild"

**If feeling run-down:**
- "If you're feeling run-down or sleep-deprived, consider skipping cardio finisher"
- "If stressed, consider dropping cardio finishers for Weeks 5-6"

## Comparison to Week 1

### What Changed

| Exercise | Week 1 (Foundation) | Week 4 (Progressive Overload) |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Squats** | Goblet Squat 3×10-12 @ RPE 6-7 | Barbell Back Squat 3×8-10 @ RPE 7-8 |
| **Deadlifts** | Barbell Deadlift 3×8-10 @ RPE 6-7 (light, form focus) | Barbell Deadlift 3×6-8 @ RPE 7-8 (heavier, 70-75% 1RM) |
| **Push-ups** | Bodyweight 3×8-12 @ RPE 6-7 | Weighted/Elevated 3×10-15 @ RPE 7-8 |
| **Shoulder Press** | Dumbbell 3×8-10 @ RPE 6-7 | Dumbbell 3×8-10 @ RPE 7-8 (heavier DBs) |
| **Rows** | Dumbbell (single-arm) 3×10/arm @ RPE 6-7 | Chest-Supported or DB 3×10-12/arm @ RPE 7-8 |
| **Plank** | 3×30-45sec | 3×45-60sec (or weighted) |

### What Stayed the Same

- **Superset structure**: 3 supersets, <15sec transitions, 60-90sec rest between
- **Training frequency**: 3 days/week (any 3 non-consecutive days)
- **Exercise patterns**: Squat, hinge (deadlift/RDL), push, pull, core in every session
- **Philosophy**: "Consistency over perfection", life-balance integration
- **Finishers**: Still optional (not mandatory)

## Use Cases

### For Agent Training
- Fine-tune `workout:generate` on progressive overload implementation
- Learn how to communicate load progression rules ("if Week 3 felt RPE 7, add 5-10lbs")
- Understand RPE progression (6-7 → 7-8) and RIR reduction (3-4 → 2-3)
- Practice barbell exercise introduction timing (goblet → barbell squat)

### For Agent Evaluation
- Benchmark progressive overload quality:
  - Are specific weight examples given? (135lbs → 145lbs)
  - Are rep range alternatives provided? (145lbs×10 OR 135lbs×12)
  - Is RPE context included? (if Week 3 felt RPE 7)
- Check fatigue auto-regulation language:
  - "Loads may be slightly lighter due to fatigue, and that's fine"
  - "Don't chase Tuesday's numbers if you're tired"
- Validate optional component framing (4th superset, finishers)

### For Database Seeding
- Seed Progressive Overload phase workout templates
- Show Week-to-Week progression examples
- Demonstrate flexible scheduling (Tue/Thu/Sat vs Mon/Wed/Fri)

### For UI Testing
- Test progressive overload display (Week 3 → Week 4 comparison UI)
- Validate optional component rendering (4th superset, finishers)
- Check load recommendation display ("if Week 3 you squatted 135lbs×10...")

### For User Onboarding
- Show realistic mid-program progression (not just Week 1 intro)
- Demonstrate how loads systematically increase
- Illustrate flexible scheduling philosophy in action
- Set expectations for session time extension (30-35min → 35-40min)

### Other Week 4 Examples
- No direct Week 4 comparisons in beginner/intermediate/advanced series (different week selections)
- Beginner uses Weeks 1, 5, 9 (form mastery → progressive overload → barbell introduction)
- Intermediate uses Weeks 1, 7, 13 (accumulation → deload → intensification)
- Advanced uses Weeks 2, 6, 10 (accumulation → wave loading → peaking)

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Tue/Thu/Sat Instead of Mon/Wed/Fri?
- **Demonstrates flexibility**: Program adapts to life schedules
- **Differentiates from Week 1**: Shows it's not rigid ("any 3 non-consecutive days")
- **Real-world scenario**: Shift workers, weekend athletes, busy professionals

### Why Introduce 4th Superset in Week 4?
- **Work capacity increased**: By Week 4, trainees can handle more volume
- **Advanced option**: Not everyone needs it—"only add if time/energy allows"
- **Progressive exposure**: Week 1 = learn technique, Week 4 = optional volume increase

### Why Second Deadlift Session (Tue + Thu)?
- **Work capacity building**: Distribute volume (3 sets×2 days = 6 sets/week) vs single session (6 sets)
- **Frequency enhances technique**: More opportunities to practice perfect setup
- **Fatigue management**: "Loads may be slightly lighter Thu due to fatigue, and that's fine"

### Why Barbell Squat in Week 4 (vs Goblet Week 1)?
- **Progressive complexity**: Week 1 = learn superset technique with simple movements, Week 4 = introduce barbell
- **Load capacity**: Goblet squats max out around 80-100lbs (large dumbbells unwieldy), barbell allows heavier loads
- **Skill development**: By Week 4, superset pacing is comfortable—cognitive load available for barbell technique

### Why Extended Session Time (35-40min vs 30-35min)?
- **Heavier loads require longer rest**: RPE 7-8 @ 70-75% loads vs RPE 6-7 @ 60-65%
- **Transparency**: Explicitly state "extended from Week 1's 30-35min due to heavier loads requiring longer rest"
- **Still efficient**: 35-40min is still 40-45% shorter than traditional training (60-75min)

## Progressive Overload Quality Standards

### ✅ Good Progressive Overload Communication
- Specific weight examples: "If Week 3 you squatted 135lbs×10, try 145lbs×10 or 135lbs×12"
- RPE context: "If Week 3 felt RPE 7 (easy), add 5-10lbs"
- Alternative progressions: "145lbs×10 OR 135lbs×12" (weight or reps)
- Fatigue auto-regulation: "Loads may be slightly lighter Thu due to fatigue, and that's fine"

### ❌ Poor Progressive Overload Communication
- Vague: "Lift heavier than last week" (how much heavier?)
- No RPE context: "Add 10lbs" (what if last week was too hard?)
- No alternatives: "145lbs×10" (what if I can't hit 10 reps?)
- Ignores fatigue: "Match Tuesday's loads" (what if I'm tired Thursday?)

## File Stats
- **File Size**: ~45KB
- **Workouts**: 3 (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday)
