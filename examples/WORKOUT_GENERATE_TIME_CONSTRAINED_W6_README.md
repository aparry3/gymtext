# Time-Constrained Week 6 workout:generate Examples

## Purpose

Reference examples demonstrating the `workout:generate` agent output for **Time-Constrained Week 6** (Progressive Overload Final Week Before Peak Test).

These examples show the culmination of 4 weeks of progressive overload (Weeks 3-6) and prepare trainees mentally and physically for Week 7's peak test.

## Context

- **Plan**: Time-Efficient Strength & Conditioning (8 weeks, 30-45min sessions, 3 days/week)
- **Week 6**: Progressive Overload Phase Final Week (Weeks 3-6)
- **Phase Goals**: Final push before Week 7 peak test, aim for upper end of rep ranges or slightly heavier loads
- **Training Parameters**: 70-75% loads @ RPE 7-8 (same as Week 4, but handling significantly more weight)
- **Session Structure**: 3 supersets per workout (optional 4th for advanced), <15sec transitions, 60-90sec rest
- **Philosophy**: "Week 6 is about finishing strong—make every rep count, maintain perfect form, and track everything"

## Week 6 Characteristics

### Progressive Overload Final Week
- **Primary Goal**: Maximize strength before Week 7's peak test (75-80% @ RPE 8-9)
- **Loads**: 70-75% estimated 1RM (same as Week 4, but handling more absolute weight)
- **RPE**: 7-8 (leave 2-3 reps in reserve)
- **Session Time**: 35-40min (potentially 40-45min with optional 4th superset)
- **Progression Rule**: Aim for upper end of rep ranges (8-10 → push for 10) or add 5-10lbs and maintain reps
- **Mental Preparation**: "This is the last time you'll squat at RPE 7-8 before Week 7's RPE 8-9 test—visualize success"

### Week 6 Training Days (Traditional Schedule Returns)
- **Monday (Day 1)**: Full Body A — Push Emphasis
- **Wednesday (Day 3)**: Full Body B — Pull Emphasis  
- **Friday (Day 5)**: Full Body C — Lower Emphasis

**Note**: Week 6 uses Mon/Wed/Fri (traditional schedule), same as Week 1. Week 4 used Tue/Thu/Sat to demonstrate flexibility. Returning to Mon/Wed/Fri shows the program adapts but also has consistency.

### What Makes Week 6 Different

| Aspect | Week 6 Special Focus |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Mental Preparation** | "Visualize success before each set" — preparing for Week 7 test |
| **Progression Target** | "Aim for upper end of rep ranges" (8-10 → push for 10) |
| **Comparison Points** | Track against Week 5 AND Week 3 (4-week progression assessment) |
| **Recovery Emphasis** | "Week 6 rest days are extra important—you're at peak training stress" |
| **Forward-Looking** | Every session mentions Week 7 preview (75-80%, RPE 8-9) and Week 8 deload |
| **Final Push Language** | "Final progressive overload session", "Make it count", "Finish strong" |

## Mental Preparation for Week 7

### Week 6 Language Preparing for Week 7

Throughout Week 6 workouts, consistent mental preparation language:

**What Week 7 Will Be:**
- "Week 7 will feel challenging (75-80% loads, RPE 8-9)—that's the point"
- "You'll be lifting 75-80% estimated 1RM for 8-10 reps @ RPE 8-9 (only 1-2 reps left in reserve)"
- "Week 7 is a peak week to see how much you've progressed"

**Building Confidence:**
- "The goal is to enter Week 7 with confidence: you've built strength and work capacity over 4 weeks, and Week 7 will test it"
- "You've been building to this for 6 weeks. Trust your training, execute with perfect form"
- "Visualize success: see yourself completing all reps with good form, bar speed fast, hitting depth"

**Setting Expectations:**
- "Week 7 is just a test, not a competition. You're testing progress, not proving anything"
- "It'll feel challenging—that's the point. Approach it with confidence"
- "If form breaks down, stop immediately. Week 7 is about seeing progress, not injuring yourself"

**Week 8 Assurance:**
- "Week 8 is a scheduled deload (40% volume reduction, 60-70% loads, RPE 6-7, no finishers)—so don't worry about pushing hard this week and next; you'll get a recovery week"
- "Week 8 you'll actively recover and assess whether to repeat the 8-week program with heavier starting weights"

## Recovery and Fatigue Management

### Week 6 Special Recovery Considerations

**Peak Training Stress:**
- "Week 6 rest days are extra important—you're at peak training stress for the Progressive Overload block"
- "You've accumulated 4 weeks of progressive overload—loads have increased by 10-20%"
- "Your muscles, joints, and nervous system need recovery to perform well"

**Sleep Emphasis:**
- Week 1: "7-8 hours per night"
- Week 4: "Prioritize sleep—aim for 8 hours if possible"
- Week 6: **"Sleep 7-8 hours minimum (8 preferred)"**

**Nutrition Guidance:**
- "Eat at maintenance or slight surplus (you're still building strength)"
- "Prioritize protein (0.8-1g per lb bodyweight)"
- "Post-Day 1 muscle protein synthesis is happening—feed it"

**Fatigue Auto-Regulation:**
- "Loads may be slightly lighter than Monday due to accumulated fatigue. That's fine and expected—don't chase Monday's numbers if you're fatigued"
- "If you plateaued, that's normal after 4 weeks of continuous progression. Week 8 deload will reset you"
- "If you're feeling very fatigued, consider skipping cardio finisher—the main supersets are what matter"

### Optional Components Decision Framework

**4th Superset (Monday only):**
- **Add if**: Feeling strong, time allows, work capacity has increased
- **Skip if**: Fatigued from 6 weeks, session would exceed 45min
- **Week 6 note**: "This week is about quality over quantity—only add if you're feeling strong"

**Cardio Finishers:**
- **Monday**: 16min row intervals (longest finisher yet)
- **Wednesday**: 5min burpees (shortest to manage fatigue)
- **Friday**: 10min farmer carries (moderate length)
- **Week 6 philosophy**: "You've been doing progressive overload for 6 weeks—you're likely feeling accumulated fatigue. Cardio finisher should be skipped if you're feeling run-down. Week 7 is peak test week, so prioritize being fresh for that over adding cardio fatigue now"

## 4-Week Assessment (Week 3-6)

### Reflection Prompts Throughout Week 6

**Monday (Day 1):**
- "How does RPE 7-8 feel now compared to Week 3? It should feel more sustainable (work capacity improved)"
- "Track loads used—you'll compare these to Week 7 heavier loads"

**Wednesday (Day 3):**
- "Compare to Week 5 Day 3—progressive overload check. How's your pull-up strength? Back thickness from rows improving?"

**Friday (Day 5):**
- "Compare loads to Week 5 Day 5 and Week 3 Day 5—how much have you progressed over 4 weeks? That's the real metric"
- "Calculate percentage increase from Week 3 to Week 6. Typical progression: 10-20% increase in 4 weeks. If you're in that range, you're on track"

**Saturday (Rest Day):**
- "Compare Week 6 loads to Week 3 loads across all exercises—calculate percentage increase"
- "Typical progression: 10-20% increase in 4 weeks on main lifts (squat, deadlift, bench, press), 15-25% increase in reps on bodyweight exercises (push-ups, pull-ups, planks)"

**Sunday (Rest Day):**
- "Assess: Strength gains—compare Week 6 maxes to Week 1 baselines"
- "Work capacity—sessions still 35-40min or have they crept longer? If longer, tighten rest periods"
- "Energy levels—do you feel more energized overall despite busy schedule, or more run-down?"

### Other Final Week Examples
- No direct Week 6 comparisons in beginner/intermediate/advanced series (different week selections and periodization)
- Beginner uses Weeks 1, 5, 9 (linear progression, no peak test)
- Intermediate uses Weeks 1, 7, 13 (block periodization, Week 7 is deload not peak)
- Advanced uses Weeks 2, 6, 10 (competition peaking, Week 10 is peaking phase not peak test)

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Return to Mon/Wed/Fri (vs Week 4's Tue/Thu/Sat)?
- **Shows consistency**: After demonstrating flexibility (Week 4 Tue/Thu/Sat), returning to traditional schedule
- **Bookends approach**: Week 1 Mon/Wed/Fri, Week 6 Mon/Wed/Fri (start and end on same schedule)
- **Real-world scenario**: Most people prefer Mon/Wed/Fri for consistency, use Tue/Thu/Sat when needed

### Why Emphasize "Final Session" Language?
- **Mental preparation**: Prepares trainees for Week 7's increased difficulty
- **Motivation**: "Final push" language creates urgency and focus
- **Closure**: Provides psychological closure on Progressive Overload block before testing

### Why Week 7 Preview Throughout?
- **Reduces anxiety**: Knowing what's coming (75-80%, RPE 8-9) prevents surprise
- **Builds confidence**: "You've been building to this for 6 weeks. Trust your training"
- **Sets expectations**: "It'll feel challenging—that's the point" normalizes difficulty

### Why Multiple Comparison Points (Week 3, Week 5, Week 7)?
- **4-week progression**: Week 3-6 is the Progressive Overload block—compare start to end
- **Week-to-week**: Week 5-6 shows recent progression
- **Forward-looking**: Week 7 preview sets next week's expectations

### Why Emphasize Recovery in Week 6?
- **Peak training stress**: 6 weeks of accumulated fatigue + 4 weeks of progressive overload
- **Performance optimization**: Need to be fresh for Week 7's peak test
- **Injury prevention**: Fatigue increases injury risk—emphasizing recovery protects trainees

## Progressive Overload Quality Standards

### ✅ Good Week 6 Programming
- Multiple comparison points: "Compare to Week 5 Day 3 AND Week 3 Day 5"
- Week 7 preview throughout: "This is the last time you'll squat at RPE 7-8 before Week 7's RPE 8-9 test"
- Mental preparation language: "Visualize success before each set"
- Recovery emphasis: "Week 6 rest days are extra important—you're at peak training stress"
- 4-week assessment: "Calculate percentage increase from Week 3 to Week 6. Typical: 10-20%"

### ❌ Poor Week 6 Programming
- No Week 7 preview: Trainees unprepared for next week's difficulty
- Only week-to-week comparison: Misses 4-week progression assessment
- No mental preparation: Doesn't build confidence for peak test
- Ignores accumulated fatigue: "Just keep pushing harder" without recovery emphasis
- Vague progression: "Lift heavier" without specific weight examples or comparison points
