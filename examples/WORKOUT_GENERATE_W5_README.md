# Workout:Generate Examples: Beginner Week 5 (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)

Structured workout data for the three training days in Beginner Week 5 (Progressive Overload Phase), corresponding to the microcycle examples in `microcycle-beginner-weeks-1-5-9.json`.

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate:
- **Progressive overload in action** — same exercises as Week 1, but higher volume and intensity
- **Tracking introduction** — explicit weight logging instructions
- **Week 1 → Week 5 progression** — volume increase (2 sets → 3 sets), intensity increase (RPE 5-6 → 6-7)
- **Beginner progressive overload** — simple rule (add weight at 3x15)

## Relationship to Week 1 Examples

**File:** `workout-generate-beginner-w1-examples.json`

Week 5 builds directly on Week 1. Same exercises, but:
- **Volume:** 2 sets (Week 1) → 3 sets (Week 5)
- **Intensity:** RPE 5-6 (Week 1) → RPE 6-7 (Week 5)
- **Focus:** Learning patterns (Week 1) → Challenging muscles (Week 5)
- **Tracking:** Not emphasized (Week 1) → Explicit instructions (Week 5)
- **Core progression:** Plank 20-30sec → 40-45sec, Dead bug 10/side → 12/side, Bird dog 8/side → 10/side

## Week 5 Context (Progressive Overload Phase)

**Phase:** Weeks 5-8: Progressive Overload  
**Progression focus:** "Increase load by 5-10lbs when hitting 3x15 reps with perfect form"

**Key characteristics:**
- Intensity: RPE 6-7 (~60-70% estimated 1RM)
- Volume: 3 sets x 12-15 reps (increased from 2 sets in Weeks 1-4)
- Rest: 60-90sec between sets (same as Week 1)
- Equipment: Still dumbbells/machines (no barbells until Week 9)
- Focus: Progressive overload via weight increases

**Tracking introduced:**
- "Track your weight: Goblet Squat __lbs"
- "If you hit 3x15 with clean form, add 5-10lbs next week"
- "Review your log: Did you hit 3x15 on any exercise?"

## Week 1 → Week 5 Progression Summary

### Volume Progression
| Exercise | Week 1 (Mon) | Week 5 (Mon) | Change |
|----------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Goblet Squat | 2x12-15 | 3x12-15 | +1 set |
| DB RDL | 2x12-15 | 3x12-15 | +1 set |

| Plank | 3x20-30s | 3x40-45s | +20sec/set |

### Intensity Progression
- **Week 1:** RPE 5-6 (~50-60% 1RM) — "Light weight, focus on learning"
- **Week 5:** RPE 6-7 (~60-70% 1RM) — "Challenging by final reps"

### Focus Shift
- **Week 1:** "Movement quality is the ONLY priority"
- **Week 5:** "Focus shifts from learning the pattern to challenging the muscles"

### Tracking Introduction
- **Week 1:** No explicit tracking instructions
- **Week 5:** "Track your weight: [Exercise] __lbs" for every main lift

### Progression Rule
- **Week 1:** N/A (still learning patterns)
- **Week 5:** "If you hit 3x15 with clean form, add 5-10lbs next week"

### Core Progression
| Exercise | Week 1 | Week 5 | Change |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Plank | 3x20-30s | 3x40-45s | +15-20s |
| Dead Bug | 3x10/side | 3x12/side | +2 reps |
| Bird Dog | 3x8/side | 3x10/side | +2 reps |

## Quality Standards

All examples meet these criteria:

### ✅ Schema Compliance
- Uses `WorkoutStructureLLMSchema` (no `id`, `exerciseId`, `nameRaw`, `resolution` fields)
- All required fields present
- Proper section structure (Warm-Up, Workout, Core, Cooldown, Optional Conditioning)
- Complete exercise objects

### ✅ Progressive Overload Features
- Volume increase from Week 1 (3 sets vs 2 sets)
- Intensity increase (RPE 6-7 vs 5-6)
- Explicit tracking instructions ("Track your weight: __lbs")
- Clear progression rule (add weight at 3x15)

### ✅ Consistency with Week 1
- Same exercises (allows for progression tracking)
- Same structure (warm-up → workout → core → cooldown)
- Same equipment (dumbbells, cables, machines)
- Logical progression (not random changes)

### ✅ Detail Level
- Specific sets/reps (3x12-15)
- Intensity guidance (RPE 6-7 + descriptions)
- Rest periods (60-90sec)
- Execution notes for every exercise
- Tracking prompts

### ✅ Tags Accuracy
- Category: ["strength", "beginner"]
- Split: ["full_body"]
- Muscles: Accurate for exercises included
- Patterns: Matches movement patterns
- Equipment: Matches requirements

## Design Decisions

**Why same exercises as Week 1?** — Progressive overload requires consistency. You can't track progress if exercises change every week.

**Why 3 sets instead of 4-5?** — Beginners still adapting to training stress. 3 sets is enough volume for growth without excessive fatigue.

**Why RPE 6-7 instead of 8-9?** — Beginners lack RPE calibration. 6-7 provides challenge without risking form breakdown.

**Why explicit tracking instructions?** — Week 5 introduces progressive overload. Tracking is mandatory for the system to work.

**Why "add weight at 3x15" instead of percentage increases?** — Simple, actionable rule. Beginners don't know their 1RM. "Hit 15 reps 3 times = add 5-10lbs" is concrete.

**Why increase core volume?** — Shows progression across all domains (main lifts AND accessory work). Plank 20-30sec → 40-45sec is measurable improvement.

**Why no tempo cues?** — Week 1 used tempo for learning. Week 5 assumes pattern mastery — tempo no longer critical coaching point.

**Why same rest periods (60-90sec)?** — Appropriate for hypertrophy/strength work in this rep range. No need to change.

**Why optional cardio on Friday?** — Tests conditioning capacity without making it mandatory. Respects beginner fatigue levels.

## Anti-Patterns Avoided

❌ **Random exercise changes** — "Week 5 does front squat instead of goblet squat"  
✅ **Exercise consistency** — Same movements as Week 1-4 for progression tracking

❌ **No tracking guidance** — Assumes user knows what to do  
✅ **Explicit tracking** — "Track your weight: Goblet Squat __lbs"

❌ **Vague progression** — "Add weight when it feels easier"  
✅ **Concrete rule** — "If you hit 3x15 with clean form, add 5-10lbs next week"

❌ **Too much volume too fast** — Jumping to 5 sets per exercise  
✅ **Conservative volume increase** — 2 sets → 3 sets (50% increase, manageable)

❌ **Too intense too fast** — Jumping to RPE 8-9  
✅ **Moderate intensity increase** — RPE 5-6 → 6-7 (one step up)

❌ **No weekly review** — User doesn't reflect on progress  
✅ **Friday review prompt** — "Review your log: Did you hit 3x15 on any exercise?"

## Usage

### For Agent Training
Use these as ground truth for `workout:generate` agent when creating progressive overload phase workouts. The agent should:
1. Maintain exercise consistency with previous phase
2. Increase volume appropriately (2 → 3 sets)
3. Increase intensity appropriately (RPE 5-6 → 6-7)
4. Add explicit tracking instructions
5. Include progression rules (when to add weight)
6. Increase core work volume/duration

### For Agent Evaluation
Compare agent output for Beginner Week 5 workouts against these examples. Check for:
1. ✅ Same exercises as Week 1 (consistency)
2. ✅ Volume increase (3 sets vs 2 sets)
3. ✅ Intensity increase (RPE 6-7 vs 5-6)
4. ✅ Tracking instructions present ("Track your weight: __lbs")
5. ✅ Progression rule stated (add weight at 3x15)
6. ✅ Core progression (plank/dead bug/bird dog duration/reps increased)
7. ✅ Appropriate tone (confident, action-oriented vs beginner-cautious)

### For UI Development
Test progressive overload features with these examples:
- Weight tracking input fields
- Progression notifications ("You hit 3x15 — add 5-10lbs next week!")
- Historical weight comparison (Week 4 vs Week 5)
- Progress charts (volume/intensity over time)

## Extending These Examples

To complete Beginner Week 5, add:
- **Tuesday:** Rest day
- **Thursday:** Rest day
- **Saturday:** Active recovery (optional light movement)
- **Sunday:** Rest day (prepare for Week 6 with weight increases)

To extend across Weeks 5-8 (Progressive Overload Phase):
- **Week 6:** Same structure, weights increased on exercises that hit 3x15 in Week 5
- **Week 7:** Continue progression, some exercises may hit 3x15 again → another weight increase
- **Week 8:** Deload week (reduce volume to 2 sets, RPE 5-6, recover before Week 9)

For Week 9+ (Barbell Introduction Phase):
- Equipment transition: Dumbbells → Barbells
- Volume adjustment: 3x10-12 (reduced reps for learning curve)
- Intensity: RPE 6-7 (start light with barbells)
- New lifts: Back squat, bench press, deadlift
