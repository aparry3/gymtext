# Workout:Generate Examples: Beginner Week 9 (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)

Structured workout data for the three training days in Beginner Week 9 (Barbell Introduction Phase), corresponding to the microcycle examples in `microcycle-beginner-weeks-1-5-9.json`.

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate:
- **Equipment transition** — Dumbbells → Barbells (major progression milestone)
- **The "big three" introduction** — Back squat, bench press, deadlift
- **Learning curve accommodation** — Reps reduced (12-15 → 10-12), start very light
- **Technical focus** — Film lifts, detailed setup cues, form over weight
- **Progressive introduction** — One new barbell lift per day (Monday: squat, Wednesday: bench, Friday: deadlift)

## Relationship to Weeks 1 & 5

**Files:** 
- `workout-generate-beginner-w1-examples.json` (PR #150)
- `workout-generate-beginner-w5-examples.json` (PR #151)

Week 9 represents a major equipment and complexity transition:

### Week 1 → Week 5 → Week 9 Progression

| Aspect | Week 1 (Form Mastery) | Week 5 (Progressive Overload) | Week 9 (Barbell Introduction) |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Equipment** | Dumbbells, machines | Dumbbells, machines | **Barbells** (big change) |
| **Volume** | 2 sets | 3 sets | 3 sets (maintained) |
| **Reps** | 12-15 | 12-15 | **10-12** (reduced for learning) |
| **Intensity** | RPE 5-6 | RPE 6-7 | RPE 6-7 (but lighter weights) |
| **Squat** | Goblet squat | Goblet squat | **Barbell back squat** |
| **Bench** | DB bench press | DB bench press | **Barbell bench press** |
| **Hinge** | DB RDL | DB RDL | **Barbell deadlift** + DB RDL |
| **Focus** | Learning patterns | Challenging muscles | **Technical mastery (barbells)** |
| **Tracking** | Not emphasized | Track weights | **Film lifts for form** |
| **Rest** | 60-90s | 60-90s | **90-120s** (barbells more demanding) |
| **Duration** | 45-55min | 50-60min | 55-65min (longer rest, more setup) |

### Key Differences

**Week 1 → Week 9:**
- Equipment: Dumbbells → Barbells
- Complexity: Isolated limb → Bilateral barbell
- Stability: Easier (DBs) → More demanding (barbells)
- Setup: Minimal → Detailed (bar position, grip, stance)
- Filming: Not mentioned → Explicitly recommended

**Week 5 → Week 9:**
- Same volume (3 sets) and intensity (RPE 6-7)
- Reps reduced: 12-15 → 10-12 (accommodate barbell learning curve)
- Rest increased: 60-90s → 90-120s (barbell lifts more taxing)
- Tracking shift: Log weights → Film lifts for form feedback
- Progressive overload paused: Focus is technical mastery, not weight increases

## Week 9 Context (Barbell Introduction Phase)

**Phase:** Weeks 9-12: Barbell Introduction  
**Progression focus:** "Introduction to barbell lifts (squat, deadlift, bench press), continue load increases"

**Key characteristics:**
- Intensity: RPE 6-7 (~60-70% 1RM, but starting very light with barbells)
- Volume: 3 sets x 10-12 reps (slightly lower than 12-15 to accommodate learning)
- Rest: 90-120s (barbells require more recovery, longer setup)
- Equipment: **Barbells** (the major transition)
- Focus: **Technical mastery over weight**
- Film lifts: Side angle for squat/deadlift, front angle for bench
- Start light: Just the bar for Set 1, add 10-20lbs for Sets 2-3 if form is clean

**The "big three" barbell lifts:**
1. **Barbell Back Squat** (Monday)
2. **Barbell Bench Press** (Wednesday)
3. **Barbell Deadlift** (Friday)

**Progressive introduction strategy:**
- Monday: Learn squat (first barbell lift)
- Wednesday: Learn bench (second barbell lift)
- Friday: Learn deadlift + practice squat & bench (all three in one session)

## Workout Breakdown

### Monday: Barbell Squat Introduction

**Focus:** First barbell lift — learn the back squat

**Structure:**
- **Warm-Up:** Light cardio (5min) + bodyweight squats 2x10 (prime the pattern)
- **Workout:** Barbell back squat (NEW) + DB RDL, DB bench press, seated cable row
- **Core:** Plank 3x45sec
- **Cooldown:** Static stretching + reflection (How did the bar feel? Any wobbling? Depth issues?)

**Key features:**
- **Barbell back squat:** 3x10-12, start with just the bar (45lbs/20kg) for Set 1
- **Detailed setup cues:** "Depth to parallel or below, chest up, knees tracking over toes, weight in heels"
- **Film your lifts:** Side angle, full body visible
- **Spotter/coach recommended:** If available
- **Rest:** 90-120sec between squat sets (longer than previous weeks)
- **Familiar exercises:** DB RDL, DB bench press, seated cable row (provide stability while learning new lift)
- **Reflection prompt:** Note any wobbling, depth issues for next week
- **Estimated duration:** 55min

**Progression notes:**
- First time using a barbell
- Goblet squat (Weeks 1-8) → Barbell back squat (Week 9+)
- Start very light (just the bar) to learn movement pattern
- Barbells require more stabilization than dumbbells

---

### Wednesday: Barbell Bench Press Introduction

**Focus:** Second barbell lift — learn the bench press

**Structure:**
- **Warm-Up:** Light cardio (5min) + push-ups 2x10 (prime the pressing pattern)
- **Workout:** Barbell bench press (NEW) + chest-supported row, lat pulldown, DB shoulder press
- **Core:** Dead bug 3x12/side
- **Cooldown:** Static stretching + reflection (Bar path straight? Comfortable grip width?)

**Key features:**
- **Barbell bench press:** 3x10-12, start with bar only (45lbs) for Set 1
- **Detailed setup:** "Lie on bench, feet flat on floor, grip slightly wider than shoulders, bar over chest (nipple line)"
- **Execution cues:** "Controlled descent (2-3sec), pause on chest, explosive press, elbows ~45° from body"
- **Spotter recommended:** Especially for beginners
- **Film your lifts:** Front angle
- **Rest:** 90-120sec between bench sets
- **Alternative option:** Can try barbell row instead of chest-supported row if confident
- **Familiar exercises:** Lat pulldown, DB shoulder press (provide stability)
- **Estimated duration:** 55min

**Progression notes:**
- Second barbell lift introduction (squat on Monday, bench on Wednesday)
- DB bench press (Weeks 1-8) → Barbell bench press (Week 9+)
- Bar path is critical (film to check)
- Pause on chest distinguishes barbell bench from DB bench

---

### Friday: Barbell Deadlift Introduction + Big Three Practice

**Focus:** Final "big three" lift + practice all three barbell lifts

**Structure:**
- **Warm-Up:** Light cardio (5min) + light DB RDLs 2x10 (prime the hinge)
- **Workout:** Barbell deadlift (NEW) + barbell back squat (2nd session), barbell bench press (2nd session), seated cable row
- **Core:** Bird dog 3x10/side
- **Cooldown:** Static stretching + celebration (You've learned all three!)

**Key features:**
- **Barbell deadlift:** 3x8-10 (slightly lower reps — deadlift is very demanding), start with bar + 25lbs per side (95lbs total)
- **Detailed setup:** "Feet hip-width, bar over mid-foot, grip just outside legs, hinge at hips, keep back neutral, push floor away"
- **Film this lift:** Side angle — back position is critical
- **Rest:** 2min between deadlift sets (longer than squat/bench)
- **Second squat session:** 3x10, should feel more confident than Monday
- **Second bench session:** 3x10, grooved the pattern on Wednesday
- **All three barbell lifts in one session:** Technical practice day
- **Celebratory tone:** "Celebrate: You've now learned the big three!"
- **Estimated duration:** 65min (longest session — all three barbell lifts)

**Progression notes:**
- Third and final barbell lift introduction
- DB RDL (Weeks 1-8) → Barbell deadlift (Week 9+) — DB RDL still used for warm-up
- Deadlift gets lowest reps (8-10) due to being most taxing
- Friday consolidates all three lifts — reinforces patterns learned Mon/Wed
- End of week = completion of barbell introduction

---

## Week 9 Unique Features

### Equipment Transition

**Dumbbells → Barbells:**
- Barbells require bilateral coordination (both sides work together)
- Higher stabilization demands (can't compensate with one side)
- Different bar path (fixed by the bar)
- More setup complexity (rack position, safety bars, spotter)

### Progressive Introduction Strategy

**One new lift per day:**
- **Monday:** Squat only (other exercises familiar)
- **Wednesday:** Bench only (other exercises familiar)
- **Friday:** Deadlift + practice squat & bench

**Why this works:**
- Cognitive load management (learning one complex movement per session)
- Provides "anchor" exercises (familiar DB/cable work)
- Friday consolidation reinforces all three patterns

### Technical Mastery Focus

**Weight is secondary:**
- Start with just the bar (45lbs/20kg)
- Add 10-20lbs only if form is clean
- Film lifts for feedback (side angle: squat/deadlift, front angle: bench)
- Detailed setup and execution cues
- Reflection prompts (What felt awkward? What needs work?)

**Form checkpoints:**
- **Squat:** Depth, chest position, knee tracking, weight distribution
- **Bench:** Bar path, elbow angle, pause on chest, grip width
- **Deadlift:** Back neutrality, hip/shoulder rise timing, bar path

### Rep Range Adjustment

**12-15 reps (Weeks 1-8) → 10-12 reps (Week 9):**
- Accommodates learning curve
- Barbell lifts are more fatiguing
- Quality over quantity (better to do 10 perfect reps than 15 sloppy ones)
- Deadlift gets even lower reps (8-10) due to being most demanding

### Rest Period Increase

**60-90sec (Weeks 1-8) → 90-120sec (Week 9):**
- Barbell lifts are more systemically fatiguing
- More setup time between sets (loading/unloading bar, rack adjustments)
- Longer rest = better form on subsequent sets
- Deadlift gets 2min rest (most taxing)

## Quality Standards

All examples meet these criteria:

### ✅ Schema Compliance
- Uses `WorkoutStructureLLMSchema` (no `id`, `exerciseId`, `nameRaw`, `resolution` fields)
- All required fields present
- Proper section structure (Warm-Up, Workout, Core, Cooldown)
- Complete exercise objects

### ✅ Barbell Introduction Features
- Start very light (just the bar for Set 1)
- Detailed setup cues for each barbell lift
- Film lifts recommendation (with camera angles specified)
- Spotter recommendation (bench press)
- Reflection prompts (identify form issues)
- Technical mastery emphasized over weight

### ✅ Progressive Introduction
- One new barbell lift per day (Monday: squat, Wednesday: bench, Friday: deadlift)
- Familiar exercises retained (DB RDL, seated cable row, etc.)
- Friday consolidates all three lifts
- Celebratory tone on Friday (milestone completion)

### ✅ Detail Level
- Specific sets/reps (3x10-12, deadlift 3x8-10)
- Intensity guidance (RPE 6-7, start with bar only)
- Rest periods (90-120sec, deadlift 2min)
- Detailed execution notes (bar path, depth, pause, etc.)
- Setup instructions (grip, stance, bar position)

### ✅ Tags Accuracy
- Category: ["strength", "beginner"]
- Split: ["full_body"]
- Muscles: Accurate for exercises
- Patterns: Includes "deadlift", "squat" (new barbell patterns)
- Equipment: Includes "barbell", "squat_rack" (new equipment)

## Design Decisions

**Why reduce reps (12-15 → 10-12)?** — Barbell lifts are technically complex and more fatiguing. Lower reps ensure quality doesn't deteriorate.

**Why start with just the bar?** — Beginners need to learn bar path and stabilization demands without excessive load. The bar (45lbs/20kg) provides sufficient challenge for pattern learning.

**Why introduce one lift per day?** — Cognitive load management. Learning squat, bench, AND deadlift in one session would be overwhelming.

**Why film lifts?** — Beginners lack proprioceptive awareness of bar path and body position. Video feedback is critical for self-correction.

**Why longer rest (90-120sec)?** — Barbell lifts recruit more muscle mass and are systemically fatiguing. Adequate rest ensures form doesn't break down.

**Why keep familiar exercises (DB RDL, seated cable row)?** — Provides "anchor" movements that build confidence while learning new complex lifts. Not everything should be new at once.

**Why all three lifts on Friday?** — Consolidation day. Reinforces squat (from Monday) and bench (from Wednesday), adds deadlift. Shows user they can handle all three in one session.

**Why deadlift gets lowest reps (8-10)?** — Deadlift is the most systemically demanding lift. Lower reps prevent form breakdown from fatigue.

**Why celebrate on Friday?** — Completing the big three introduction is a major milestone. Positive reinforcement builds adherence.

## Anti-Patterns Avoided

❌ **All three lifts introduced Monday** — Cognitive overload, overwhelming  
✅ **Progressive introduction** — One lift per day (Mon: squat, Wed: bench, Fri: deadlift)

❌ **Starting heavy** — "Work up to a heavy single"  
✅ **Start very light** — Just the bar for Set 1, add 10-20lbs if form is clean

❌ **No filming guidance** — Assumes user knows what good form looks like  
✅ **Explicit filming recommendation** — Camera angles specified, reflection prompts

❌ **Same reps as previous weeks (12-15)** — Too many reps for complex lifts  
✅ **Reduced reps (10-12, deadlift 8-10)** — Accommodates learning curve

❌ **No setup cues** — "Do barbell squats"  
✅ **Detailed setup** — Grip, stance, bar position, execution cues

❌ **No spotter recommendation** — Unsafe for bench press  
✅ **Spotter recommended** — Especially for beginners learning barbell bench

❌ **Same rest periods (60-90s)** — Insufficient for barbell work  
✅ **Longer rest (90-120s, deadlift 2min)** — Adequate recovery for form

❌ **Weight progression emphasized** — "Add 10lbs every session"  
✅ **Technical mastery emphasized** — "Weight is secondary this week"

## Usage

### For Agent Training
Use these as ground truth for `workout:generate` agent when creating barbell introduction workouts. The agent should:
1. Introduce barbell lifts progressively (one per day, not all at once)
2. Start very light (just the bar for Set 1)
3. Provide detailed setup and execution cues
4. Recommend filming lifts (specify camera angles)
5. Reduce reps to accommodate learning curve (10-12, deadlift 8-10)
6. Increase rest periods (90-120s, deadlift 2min)
7. Retain familiar exercises for stability
8. Emphasize technical mastery over weight

### For Agent Evaluation
Compare agent output for Beginner Week 9 workouts against these examples. Check for:
1. ✅ Progressive introduction (one new barbell lift per day)
2. ✅ Start very light (bar only for Set 1)
3. ✅ Detailed setup cues (grip, stance, bar position)
4. ✅ Filming recommendation (camera angles specified)
5. ✅ Reduced reps (10-12, deadlift 8-10 vs 12-15 in previous weeks)
6. ✅ Longer rest (90-120s vs 60-90s)
7. ✅ Familiar exercises retained (DB RDL, seated cable row, etc.)
8. ✅ Technical mastery emphasized (not weight progression)

### For UI Development
Test barbell introduction features with these examples:
- Exercise tutorial links (barbell squat/bench/deadlift form videos)
- Filming guidance prompts ("Film side angle for squat")
- Form feedback integration (upload video, get AI feedback)
- Spotter recommendations (for bench press)
- Equipment requirements (squat rack, barbell, bench, safety bars)

## Extending These Examples

To complete Beginner Week 9, add:
- **Tuesday:** Rest day (recovery from new barbell squat)
- **Thursday:** Rest day (recovery from new barbell bench)
- **Saturday:** Active recovery (gentle movement after learning all three lifts)
- **Sunday:** Rest day (reflect on videos, prepare for Week 10)

To extend across Weeks 9-12 (Barbell Introduction Phase):
- **Week 10:** Same lifts, add 5-10lbs if form was clean in Week 9
- **Week 11:** Continue progression, refine technique
- **Week 12:** Deload (reduce to 2 sets, RPE 5-6) OR test day (work up to heavy singles to establish baseline)

For Weeks 13+ (Intermediate Programming):
- Higher volume (4-5 sets)
- More complex periodization (wave loading, block periodization)
- Advanced techniques (pause reps, tempo variations, cluster sets)
- Accessory work specialization
