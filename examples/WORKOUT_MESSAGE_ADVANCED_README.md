# Workout:Message Examples: Advanced (All 9 Workouts)

SMS-formatted daily workout messages for Advanced Powerlifting Peaking plan, demonstrating progression across three critical phases.

## Purpose

This file contains 9 SMS-formatted daily workout messages corresponding 1:1 with the structured workout examples (PR #178), demonstrating:
- **Technical/terse communication style** appropriate for advanced lifters
- **Competition-focused language** (percentages, bar speed, meet preparation)
- **Safety protocol integration** (fail-safe rep rules, spotter requirements)
- **Progressive intensity across phases** (accumulation → wave loading → peaking)

```

## Advanced Message Characteristics

### 1. Technical/Terse Tone

**Assumes knowledge:**
- No explanation of RPE, 1RM, or basic form cues
- Uses percentages and bar speed thresholds
- References competition context ("Week 11: heavy singles, then Week 12 taper")

**Example (Week 6 Monday):**
> "Week 2 of wave (Week 5: 80%, Week 6: 82.5%, Week 7: 85%). Bar speed critical—third rep should be hard but fast. If grinds >3sec, reduce 10lbs next set."

### 2. Safety Protocol Integration

**Bar speed thresholds (quantitative, not qualitative):**

**Week 2 (Accumulation):**
- Squat: "If bar speed slows significantly on reps 4-5, reduce next set"

**Week 6 (Wave Loading):**
- Squat: "If grinds >3sec, reduce 10lbs next set"
- Bench: "If stalls mid-press, reduce 5lbs"
- Deadlift: "If second or third rep grinds >4-5sec or form breaks, STOP SET"

**Week 10 (Peaking):**
- Squat: "If second stalls or >6sec, reduce 10lbs"
- Bench: "If bar stalls, weight too heavy"
- Deadlift: "CRITICAL: If first rep >4sec or RPE 9.5, do NOT attempt second"

**Progression:** Qualitative → Quantitative → Strict fail-safe rules.

### 3. Competition-Focused Language

**References to meet preparation:**
- "Competition > percentages" (Week 6 Tuesday)
- "Week 11: heavy singles (95-97.5%), then Week 12 taper" (Week 10 Tuesday)
- "Visualize Thursday's deadlifts" (Week 10 Monday)

**Performance context:**
- "Perfect setup non-negotiable—spotter assists liftoff" (Week 6 Tuesday)
- "Setup is everything. Spotter MUST be present—communicate liftoff" (Week 10 Tuesday)

### 4. Progressive Load Communication

**Week 2 (Accumulation):**
- "~70-75% 1RM" (approximate, educational)
- "If Week 1 felt RPE 7, add 5-10lbs today"

**Week 6 (Wave Loading):**
- "82.5% 1RM" (precise percentage)
- "Week 2 of wave (Week 5: 80%, Week 6: 82.5%, Week 7: 85%)"

**Week 10 (Peaking):**
- "92.5% 1RM" (precise)
- "Near-maximal. First rep should move with decent speed; second will grind—expected"

### 5. CNS Recovery Emphasis

**Week 2:**
- "Session: ~85min" (duration only)
- "Track: weight, reps, RPE, bar speed notes"

**Week 6:**
- "Session: ~80min"
- "Friday is rest—use it. Sleep 7-8hr tonight"

**Week 10:**
- "Session: ~75min"
- "Sleep 8-9hr non-negotiable"
- "Friday: complete rest"
- "All energy to competition lifts"

**Progression:** Basic tracking → Recovery mentions → Strict recovery mandates.

## Message Length Analysis

| Week | Phase | Monday | Tuesday | Thursday | Avg |
|------|-------|--------|---------|----------|-----|
| 2 | Accumulation | 145w | 152w | 147w | 148w |

- **Wave Loading:** ~146 words (maintained detail, added bar speed thresholds)
- **Peaking:** ~125 words (15-20% shorter, accessories eliminated, focus on main lift)
- **All SMS-friendly:** Under 200 words, typically 2-3 SMS segments

## Beginner vs Intermediate vs Advanced Comparison

### Tone & Assumptions

| Level | Tone | Assumes | Example |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| Beginner | Welcoming, educational | Nothing (explains RPE, soreness, form basics) | "RPE 5-6 means leave 4-5 reps in reserve" |
| Intermediate | Confident, prescriptive | Basic knowledge (RPE, tracking, muscle groups) | "RPE 7-8 on compounds, RPE 8-9 on isolation" |
| Advanced | Technical, terse | Competition context, percentages, bar speed | "82.5% 1RM @ RPE 8-9, rest 3-4min" |

### Safety Communication

| Level | Week 1-2 | Mid-Program | Late Program |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Beginner | "If something hurts (sharp pain), stop" | "Track sets/reps" | "If form breaks down, reduce weight" |
| Intermediate | "Track weight/reps/RPE" | "Form is CRITICAL—don't round back" | "Rest-pause final sets" |
| Advanced | "If bar speed slows significantly, reduce" | "If grinds >3sec, reduce 10lbs" | "If first rep >4sec, do NOT attempt second" |

### Volume Communication

| Level | Format | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Beginner | Sets×Reps only | "3×12-15" |
| Intermediate | Sets×Reps + RPE + rest | "4×8 @ RPE 7-8, rest 2-3min" |
| Advanced | Sets×Reps + RPE + %1RM + rest + bar speed | "4×3 @ RPE 8-9 (82.5% 1RM), rest 3-4min" |

### Message Length

| Level | Accumulation | Deload | Intensification/Peaking |
|-------|--------------|--------|------------------------|
| Beginner | ~135w | N/A (no explicit deload) | ~145w |
| Intermediate | ~135w | ~105w | ~147w |
| Advanced | ~148w | N/A (not included in these examples) | ~125w |

**Note:** Advanced peaking messages are shorter than accumulation (fewer accessories, focus on main lift).

- Performance prioritization ("Competition > percentages")

### ✅ Progressive Intensity

## Design Decisions

### Why Shorter in Peaking (125w vs 148w)?

**Fewer accessories:**
- Week 2: 3-4 accessories listed
- Week 10: 1-2 maintenance movements

**Focus shift:**
- Week 2: "Building work capacity" (process-focused)
- Week 10: "Near-maximal" (outcome-focused)

**Less explanation needed:**
- Week 2: "If Week 1 felt RPE 7, add 5-10lbs today" (guidance)
- Week 10: "If second stalls or >6sec, reduce 10lbs" (rule)

### Why Include Percentages (not just RPE)?

**Advanced lifters program with percentages:**
- More precise than RPE alone
- Aligns with competition prep (openers often % of max)
- Allows comparison to training logs

**Example:**
- Beginner: "3×15 @ RPE 5-6"
- Intermediate: "4×8 @ RPE 7-8"
- Advanced: "4×3 @ RPE 8-9 (82.5% 1RM)"

### Why "CRITICAL" and "MUST" Language?

**Near-maximal loads require strict safety:**
- Week 10 Deadlift: "CRITICAL: If first rep >4sec..."
- Week 10 Bench: "Spotter MUST be present"

**Not scare tactics—risk management:**
- Grinding reps at 92.5% → injury risk high
- Failing bench at 92.5% without spotter → dangerous
- Competition preparation > hitting arbitrary percentages

### Why Reference Future Weeks?

**Builds context and motivation:**
- Week 6: "Week 7 will be hardest, then Week 8 deload"
- Week 10: "Week 11: heavy singles (95-97.5%), then Week 12 taper"

**Reduces anxiety about current difficulty:**
- Knowing a deload is coming helps push through hard weeks
- Knowing taper approaches helps tolerate peaking fatigue
