## Quality Standards

All 9 examples meet these criteria:

### ✅ Format Compliance
- Follows MESSAGE_FORMAT.md structure
- Proper section titles (end with colon)
- Exercise format: `- Exercise: setsxreps`
- Notes section with key cues

### ✅ SMS-Friendly
- Scannable on phone screen
- Compact (180-230 words)
- No unnecessary words
- Clear, unambiguous

### ✅ Beginner-Appropriate
- Week 1: Welcoming, cautious, learning focus
- Week 5: Confident, tracking introduced, progression rules
- Week 9: Milestone, technical cues, safety notes

### ✅ Progression Logic
- Volume increases (2 → 3 sets)
- Intensity increases (RPE 5-6 → 6-7)
- Equipment transitions (dumbbells → barbells at Week 9)
- Tracking evolves (none → log weights → film lifts)
- Tone evolves (welcoming → confident → celebratory)

### ✅ Coaching Quality
- Week 1: Form emphasis, conservative
- Week 5: Tracking, progression rules
- Week 9: Safety (spotter), filming, detailed setup

## Design Decisions

**Why longer messages in Week 9?** — Barbell lifts require more setup detail (bar position, grip, stance) and safety notes (spotter, filming).

**Why introduce tracking in Week 5, not Week 1?** — Week 1 is about learning patterns. Tracking adds cognitive load. Week 5 users have pattern mastery and are ready for progressive overload.

**Why "JUST THE BAR (45lbs)" in all caps?** — Emphasis. Beginners often want to load the bar immediately. ALL CAPS draws attention to starting light.

**Why specify camera angles (side angle, front angle)?** — Different lifts need different angles for form feedback. Side angle shows squat depth and deadlift back position. Front angle shows bench bar path and elbow position.

**Why "Celebrate:" prompts?** — Positive reinforcement builds adherence. Week 1 Friday and Week 9 Friday are milestones (first week complete, big three learned).

**Why Notes section at end, not inline?** — Keeps workout list clean and scannable. Users can read exercises quickly, then check notes for details.
