# Workout:Message Examples — Intermediate All 9 Workouts

## Purpose
This file consolidates **all 9 intermediate daily workout messages** (Weeks 1, 7, 13 × Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) into a single comprehensive reference demonstrating SMS-formatted workout delivery across the complete intermediate PPL progression: accumulation → deload → intensification.

## Format: Daily Workout Messages

Unlike weekly previews (microcycle:message), daily workout messages provide:
- **Exercise prescription** (sets, reps, RPE)
- **Section organization** (compounds → accessories → isolation)
- **Execution notes** (rest periods, technique cues, safety warnings)
- **Phase-appropriate guidance** (tracking for accumulation, active recovery for deload, advanced techniques for intensification)

## Coverage

### Week 1 (Accumulation Launch) - 3 messages
- **Monday**: Push (Chest/Shoulders) — Bench 4x8, incline DB, laterals, triceps
- **Tuesday**: Pull (Back/Biceps) — Deadlift 4x6, pull-ups, rows, curls
- **Wednesday**: Legs (Quad) — Squat 4x8 (3-1-X tempo), leg press, Bulgarian, extensions

### Week 7 (Deload) - 3 messages
- **Thursday**: Push (Triceps/Front Delts) — 2 sets all exercises, RPE 6-7, 70-80% loads
- **Friday**: Pull (Rear Delts/Biceps) — 2 sets, NO deadlift, RPE 6-7
- **Saturday**: Legs (Hamstring/Glute) — 2 sets, NO squat, RPE 6-7

### Week 13 (Peak Intensification) - 3 messages

**Total**: 9 SMS-formatted daily workout messages demonstrating intermediate PPL across three training phases

## Message Structure

All messages follow **MESSAGE_FORMAT.md** standard:

```
[TITLE]: [Focus]

[Section Type]:
- Exercise: Sets x Reps @ RPE (rest period)
- Exercise: Sets x Reps @ RPE
...

[Section Type]:
- Exercise: Sets x Reps @ RPE
...

Notes: [Phase-specific guidance, rest periods, key cues, session time]
```

## Message Length Comparison

| Week | Phase | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Avg |
|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **W1** | Accumulation | 140w | 135w | 130w | - | - | - | **135w** |
| **W7** | Deload | - | - | - | 110w | 105w | 100w | **105w** |
| **W13** | Intensification | 155w | 145w | 140w | - | - | - | **147w** |

**Key insight**: 
- Accumulation: ~135 words (moderate detail, tracking emphasis)
- Deload: ~105 words (shorter, active recovery framing)
- Intensification: ~147 words (longer due to advanced technique execution details)

All messages stay SMS-friendly (under 200 words, typically 2-3 SMS segments).

## Advanced Technique Communication (Week 13)

### Rest-Pause
**Format**: `(Set 4: REST-PAUSE—6 reps, rack, 15-20sec rest, 2-3 more reps)`

**Monday (Bench)**:
> "Set 4: REST-PAUSE—6 reps, rack, 15-20sec rest, 2-3 more reps"

**Tuesday (Deadlift)**:
> "Set 4: REST-PAUSE—5 reps, 20-30sec rest, 1-2 more. Form CRITICAL—don't round back"

**Wednesday (Squat)**:
> "Set 4: REST-PAUSE—6 reps, rack, 20sec rest, 2-3 more. Stay focused"

**Differences**:
- Deadlift: Longer rest (20-30sec vs 15-20sec), fewer rest-pause reps (1-2 vs 2-3), explicit safety warning
- Squat: Focus cue ("Stay focused" for neural demand)

### Slow Eccentrics
**Format**: `(Set 3: 4-5sec eccentric every rep)`

**All three days** (incline press, pull-ups, Bulgarian split squats):
> "Set 3: 4-5sec eccentric every rep"

**Consistent format** — no need for additional execution detail (4-5sec descent is self-explanatory).

### Drop Sets
**Format**: `(Set 3: DROP SET—failure, drop [%], [reps] more reps)`

**Monday (Lateral Raises)**:
> "Set 3: DROP SET—failure, drop 30-40%, 8-10 more reps"

**Tuesday (Barbell Curls)**:
> "Set 3: DROP SET—failure, drop 30%, 8-10 more"

**Wednesday (Leg Extensions)**:
> "Set 3: DROP SET—failure, drop 40%, 10-12 more. Expect burn"

**Differences**:
- Leg extensions: Highest weight drop (40%), most reps (10-12), expectation note ("Expect burn")

## Deload Communication (Week 7)

### Strategic Omissions
**Friday (Pull)**:
> "PULL: Rear Delts & Biceps (DELOAD)
> ...
> Notes: DELOAD. **NO deadlift today (posterior chain rests)**."

**Saturday (Legs)**:
> "LEGS: Hamstring & Glute (DELOAD)
> ...
> Notes: DELOAD. **NO squat today (covered Wednesday)**."

**Why explicit**:
- Prevents confusion ("Where's the deadlift?")
- Educates on rationale (posterior chain rest, quads already deloaded)
- Reassures trainee (this is intentional, not a mistake)

### Active Recovery Framing
**Consistent across all 3 deload messages**:
- "This is ACTIVE recovery—feel strong and controlled, not fatigued" (Thursday)
- "Focus on quality reps—smooth and controlled" (Friday)
- "You should feel fresh. Deload week complete!" (Saturday)

**Purpose**: Combats guilt about lifting lighter, reframes deload as productive recovery.

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid these in intermediate workout:message examples:
- ❌ Missing exercise categorization (should have Compounds/Accessories/Isolation sections)
- ❌ Missing rest periods (should specify 2-3min compounds, 90s accessories, 60s isolation)
- ❌ Vague load guidance ("go heavy" instead of "70-75% 1RM")
- ❌ Missing advanced technique execution details ("rest-pause" without explaining how)
- ❌ Final sets not specified ("rest-pause on bench" vs "Set 4: REST-PAUSE")
- ❌ Missing deload framing (no "active recovery" language)
- ❌ Strategic omissions not explained ("no deadlift" without rationale)
- ❌ Missing safety reminders (Week 13 deadlift needs "Form CRITICAL")
- ❌ No expectation setting (Week 13 needs "Expect DOMS/burn/pump")
- ❌ Too long (>200 words breaks SMS-friendly goal)
- ❌ Too short (<100 words lacks necessary detail for intermediate trainees)
