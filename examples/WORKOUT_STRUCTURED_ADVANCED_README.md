# Workout:Structured Examples: Advanced (All 9 Workouts)

Consolidated structured workout examples for Advanced Powerlifting Peaking plan, showing complete progression across three critical phases.

## Purpose

This file consolidates all 9 advanced powerlifting workout examples into a single comprehensive reference, demonstrating:
- **Complete periodization arc:** Accumulation → Wave Loading → Peaking
- **Volume/intensity inverse relationship:** As intensity increases, volume decreases
- **Sport-specific powerlifting programming:** Competition lifts, secondary variations, minimal accessories
- **CNS management strategies:** Progressive fatigue accumulation and recovery prioritization

## Coverage

### Week 2 (Accumulation Phase) — 3 workouts
- **Monday:** Squat 5×5 @ 70-75% RPE 7-8
- **Tuesday:** Bench 5×5 @ 70-75% RPE 7-8
- **Thursday:** Deadlift 5×4 @ 70-75% RPE 7-8

**Phase goal:** Build work capacity, refine technique, accumulate volume at moderate intensity.

### Week 6 (Wave Loading Phase) — 3 workouts
- **Monday:** Squat 4×3 @ 82.5% RPE 8-9
- **Tuesday:** Bench 4×3 @ 82.5% RPE 8-9
- **Thursday:** Deadlift 4×2-3 @ 82.5% RPE 8-9

**Phase goal:** Progressive intensity increase via wave loading (80%→82.5%→85%), manage fatigue with reduced volume.

### Week 10 (Peaking Phase) — 3 workouts
- **Monday:** Squat 3×2 @ 92.5% RPE 9.5
- **Tuesday:** Bench 3×2 @ 92.5% RPE 9.5
- **Thursday:** Deadlift 3×1-2 @ 92.5% RPE 9.5

**Phase goal:** Prepare CNS and confidence for near-maximal loads, minimal volume to manage fatigue before competition.

## Periodization Arc

### Volume Progression (Inverse Relationship)

| Week | Phase | Squat Reps | Bench Reps | Deadlift Reps | % 1RM |
|------|-------|------------|------------|---------------|-------|
| 2 | Accumulation | 25 (5×5) | 25 (5×5) | 20 (5×4) | 70-75% |
| 6 | Wave Loading | 12 (4×3) | 12 (4×3) | 8-12 (4×2-3) | 82.5% |
| 10 | Peaking | 6 (3×2) | 6 (3×2) | 3-6 (3×1-2) | 92.5% |

**Observation:** Volume drops from 25 to 6 reps (76% reduction) while intensity increases from 70% to 92.5% (32% increase).

### Rest Period Progression

| Week | Phase | Main Lifts | Secondaries | Accessories |
|------|-------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 2 | Accumulation | 3 min | 2-3 min | 90sec-2min |
| 6 | Wave Loading | 3-4 min | 3 min | 2 min |
| 10 | Peaking | 4-5 min | 2-3 min | N/A (eliminated) |

**Observation:** Rest periods increase by 67% for main lifts to ensure quality at higher intensities.

### Accessory Progression (Elimination Strategy)

| Week | Phase | Exercises | Example |
|------|-------|-----------|---------|
| 2 | Accumulation | 9-12 total | RDL 3×8, Bulgarian split squat 3×10/leg, Leg press 3×12-15 |
| 6 | Wave Loading | 7-9 total | RDL 3×6-8, Leg press 3×10-12 (Bulgarian eliminated) |
| 10 | Peaking | 4-6 total | Light RDL 2×8-10 (maintenance only) |

**Observation:** Accessories reduced from 9-12 to 4-6 exercises (50-67% reduction), with shift from hypertrophy to maintenance.

## Key Programming Concepts

### 1. Competition Lift Prioritization

All three workouts across all three weeks feature the competition lifts:
- **Squat** (Monday)
- **Bench** (Tuesday)
- **Deadlift** (Thursday)

**Frequency:** Each competition lift practiced 1x per week (enough for skill retention at advanced level).

### 2. Secondary Variations (Weak Point Targeting)

**Week 2 (Accumulation):**
- Pause squats (addresses weakness out of the hole)
- Close-grip bench (lockout/triceps strength)
- Deficit deadlift (off-the-floor strength)

**Week 6 (Wave Loading):**
- Front squat (lighter, maintains squat frequency)
- Close-grip bench (reduced volume)
- Deficit deadlift (reduced volume)

**Week 10 (Peaking):**
- Light front squat (maintenance only, 2 sets)
- Light close-grip bench (maintenance only, 2 sets)
- Eliminated for deadlift (all energy to the pull)

### 3. Bar Speed Monitoring (Auto-Regulation)

**Week 2:**
- "If bar speed slows significantly on rep 4-5, reduce next set"
- Qualitative guidance

**Week 6:**
- "If third rep grinds >3sec, reduce 5-10lbs next set"
- Quantitative thresholds introduced

**Week 10:**
- "If first deadlift rep >4sec, do NOT attempt second rep"
- Strict fail-safe rules to prevent injury

**Progression:** From qualitative suggestions to strict safety protocols as intensity increases.

### 4. RPE Calibration Across Phases

| Week | Phase | RPE | RIR (Reps in Reserve) | Description |
|------|-------|-----|----------------------|-------------|
| 2 | Accumulation | 7-8 | 2-3 | Moderate effort, controlled |
| 6 | Wave Loading | 8-9 | 1-2 | Hard effort, third rep challenging |
| 10 | Peaking | 9.5 | 0-1 | Near-maximal, second rep grinds |

### 5. CNS Recovery Management

**Week 2 (High Volume):**
- Session time: 80-90 min
- Rest days: Wednesday, Friday, Sunday
- Sleep: 7-8 hours minimum
- Nutrition: Maintenance or slight surplus

**Week 6 (Moderate Volume, High Intensity):**
- Session time: 75-85 min
- Rest days: Wednesday, Friday, Sunday
- Sleep: 7-8 hours minimum
- Nutrition: Maintenance, prioritize pre/post-workout

**Week 10 (Minimal Volume, Maximal Intensity):**
- Session time: 70-80 min
- Rest days: Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
- Sleep: 8-9 hours **non-negotiable**
- Nutrition: Maintenance, hydration critical

## Comparison: Beginner vs Intermediate vs Advanced

### Training Frequency

| Level | Days/Week | Split | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Beginner | 3 | Full body | Skill acquisition, recovery between sessions |
| Intermediate | 6 | PPL | Hypertrophy focus, 2x frequency per muscle |
| Advanced | 4 | Upper/Lower | Powerlifting specificity, CNS recovery priority |

### Volume per Muscle Group (Accumulation Phase)

| Level | Chest | Back | Quads | Hamstrings |
|-------|-------|------|-------|------------|
| Beginner W1 | 4-6 sets/week | 4-6 sets/week | 4-6 sets/week | 2-4 sets/week |
| Intermediate W1 | 12-14 sets/week | 14-16 sets/week | 14-16 sets/week | 8-10 sets/week |
| Advanced W2 | 20-25 sets/week (comp lift) | N/A (rows for stability) | 20-25 sets/week (comp lift) | 12-15 sets/week |

**Note:** Advanced volume is concentrated in competition lifts (squat/bench/deadlift) rather than distributed across muscle groups.

### Progression Strategy

| Level | Model | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Beginner | Linear progression | Add 5-10lbs when hitting 3×15 |
| Intermediate | Block periodization | Accumulation → Deload → Intensification |
| Advanced | Wave loading + Peaking | Accumulation → Wave (80/82.5/85%) → Peak (90/92.5/95%) → Taper |

### Exercise Complexity

| Level | Example | Technique |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Beginner | Goblet squat, DB bench, DB RDL | Basic patterns |
| Intermediate | Barbell bench, pull-ups, front squat | Barbell proficiency |
| Advanced | Competition squat/bench/deadlift + pause/deficit variations | Sport-specific, weak-point targeting |

## Quality Standards

These advanced workouts meet all standards:

### ✅ Sport-Specific Programming
- Competition lifts (squat/bench/deadlift) every workout
- Secondary variations address specific weak points
- Accessories minimal and targeted (upper back for bench stability, posterior chain for deadlift)

### ✅ Periodization Integrity
- Accumulation: Volume builds (5×5, moderate intensity)
- Wave Loading: Intensity increases via wave pattern (80%→82.5%→85%)
- Peaking: Maximal intensity, minimal volume (3×2 @ 92.5%)

### ✅ Safety Integration
- Bar speed monitoring (qualitative → quantitative → strict)
- Spotter requirements (bench at 82.5%+)
- Fail-safe rep rules (deadlift: if first rep slow, stop)
- Load reduction guidance (specific weight reductions)

### ✅ Auto-Regulation
- RPE-based loading (accounts for day-to-day variation)
- Bar speed as objective fatigue measure
- Set-by-set adjustments ("reduce next set" not "reduce today")

### ✅ Realistic Execution
- Detailed setup instructions (walkout, grip, bracing)
- Common mistakes highlighted (dive-bombing, shooting hips up)
- Recording instructions (weight, reps, RPE, bar speed notes)
- Session time realistic (70-90 min including warm-up/cooldown)

## Design Decisions

### Why Upper/Lower Split (not PPL)?

**PPL (Intermediate):** 6 days/week, each muscle 2x/week, hypertrophy focus.
**Upper/Lower (Advanced):** 4 days/week, competition lifts 1x/week, strength/skill focus.

Advanced powerlifters prioritize:
1. **CNS recovery:** Heavy squats/deadlifts require 2-3 days recovery
2. **Competition specificity:** Practice competition lifts, not muscle groups
3. **Minimal effective dose:** 1x/week sufficient for strength maintenance/gains at advanced level

### Why Week 2, Week 6, Week 10?

**Week 2:** Mid-accumulation (Week 1 establishes baseline, Week 2 shows progression)
**Week 6:** Wave loading peak (80% → **82.5%** → 85%)
**Week 10:** Peaking peak (90% → **92.5%** → 95% singles)

These represent critical transition/peak points in each phase.

### Why Front Squat on Both Monday and Thursday?

**Monday (Week 2):** Secondary variation after heavy competition squat (4×3 @ RPE 7)
**Thursday (Week 2):** Lighter secondary squat after deadlifts (3×6 @ RPE 7-8)

**Purpose:**
- Maintains squat frequency (2x per week for skill retention)
- Different intensities (Monday harder, Thursday lighter)
- Doesn't compete with main lifts (Monday: squat is done, Thursday: front squat lighter than back squat)

### Why Deadlift 4×2-3 (Week 6) and 3×1-2 (Week 10)?

**Deadlifts are uniquely fatiguing:**
- Grip demand (hard to maintain for 3+ reps at 82.5%+)
- Posterior chain fatigue (entire chain loaded maximally)
- CNS demand (whole-body coordination at near-maximal loads)

**Flexibility acknowledges individual variation:** Some lifters can do doubles, others only singles at 92.5%.

### Why Eliminate Accessories in Week 10?

**Peaking philosophy:** Every ounce of energy → competition lifts.

**Week 10 accessories:**
- Monday: Light RDL 2×8-10 (maintain hamstring function)
- Tuesday: Face pulls 2×15-20 (shoulder health non-negotiable)
- Thursday: NONE (all energy to deadlift)

**Hypertrophy ≠ goal.** Maintenance and recovery ARE the goal.
