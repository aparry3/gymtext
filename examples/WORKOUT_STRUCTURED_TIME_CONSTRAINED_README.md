## Superset Structure and Tagging

### Superset Pairs Across All Weeks

**Antagonist Pairs** (allow recovery while other muscle works):
- Push-ups + Rows (Week 1 Mon, Week 4 Tue, Week 6 Mon)
- Bench Press + Squats (Week 1 Wed/Fri, Week 4 Thu/Sat, Week 6 Wed/Fri)

**Non-Competing Pairs** (minimal interference):
- Squat + Push-ups (Week 1 Mon, Week 4 Tue, Week 6 Mon)
- Deadlift + Pull-ups/Shoulder Press (Week 1 Wed, Week 4 Tue/Thu, Week 6 Mon/Wed)
- RDL + Dumbbell Rows/Curls (Week 1 Mon/Wed/Fri, Week 4 Thu/Sat, Week 6 Wed)

**Core as Finisher**:
- Plank at end of Superset 3 every Day 1 (Mon/Tue) across all weeks

### Superset ID Tagging

All exercises properly tagged with `supersetId`:
- `"S1"`: Superset 1 exercises
- `"S2"`: Superset 2 exercises
- `"S3"`: Superset 3 exercises
- `"S4"`: Optional 4th superset (Week 4-6, Day 1 only)
- `""` (empty): Warm-up, cooldown, optional finishers

## Time Efficiency Mechanisms

### 30% Time Savings Breakdown

**Traditional Training** (straight sets, 2-3min rest between all exercises):
- 3 exercises × 3 sets each = 9 sets
- Set time: ~1min (warmup + work + rest)
- Rest between sets: 2-3min
- Total: 9 sets × 3.5min avg = ~31.5min

**Superset Training** (this program):
- 3 supersets × 3 sets each = 9 sets
- Superset time: Exercise A (~1min) + transition (<15sec) + Exercise B (~1min) + rest (60-90sec) = ~3.5min per superset round
- Total: 3 supersets × 3 rounds × 3.5min = ~31.5min for same 9 sets

**BUT**: Superset training does MORE work in same time:
- Superset: 9 sets across 6 exercises in 31.5min
- Traditional: 9 sets across 3 exercises in 31.5min
- **Result**: 2× exercise variety, same time commitment

### Session Time Components

**Week 1 (30-35min total)**:
- Warm-up: 5-10min
- 3 Supersets: 20-25min (3 supersets × 3 rounds × 2.5-3min)
- Cooldown: 5min
- Optional Finisher: +5min (if added)

**Week 4-6 (35-40min total)**:
- Warm-up: 5-10min
- 3 Supersets: 25-30min (heavier loads = longer rest within 60-90sec window)
- Cooldown: 5min
- Optional Finisher: +8-10min (if added)

## Format Compliance

All 9 workouts follow `WorkoutStructureLLMSchema`:
- ✅ Uses `structuredWorkout` object (not `workout`)
- ✅ Omits LLM-unsafe fields: `id`, `exerciseId`, `nameRaw`, `resolution`
- ✅ Includes all required fields: `title`, `focus`, `description`, `quote`, `sections`
- ✅ Section structure: `title`, `overview`, `exercises[]`
- ✅ Exercise schema compliance:
  - `name`, `type`, `sets`, `reps`, `rest`, `intensity`, `tempo`, `notes`, `tags`, `supersetId`
  - Optional fields (e.g., `duration`, `distance`) use empty strings when not applicable
- ✅ Intensity object: `{ type, value, description }` (RPE or Other)
- ✅ Superset tagging: "S1", "S2", "S3", "S4", "" (empty for non-supersets)

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Consolidate 9 Workouts into Single File?
- **Easier agent training**: Load once, get all 9 workouts (vs 3 separate imports)
- **Simplified database seeding**: Single JSON import operation
- **Clearer progression narrative**: See Week 1 → Week 4 → Week 6 in one place
- **Consistent with other plans**: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced all have consolidated files

### Why Include Optional Components?
- **4th Superset** (Week 4-6 Day 1): Shows advanced trainee progression, demonstrates work capacity increase
- **Cardio Finishers** (all weeks): Shows truly optional nature (5-16min range), "skip if fatigued" philosophy

### Why Flexible Scheduling (Mon/Wed/Fri and Tue/Thu/Sat)?
- **Demonstrates program adaptability**: Not rigid, fits life schedules
- **Week 1**: Mon/Wed/Fri (traditional recommendation)
- **Week 4**: Tue/Thu/Sat (shift worker, weekend athlete scenario)
- **Week 6**: Mon/Wed/Fri (returns to traditional—bookends approach)

### Why Superset Tagging Matters?
- **UI rendering**: Allows visual grouping of superset exercises
- **Transition timers**: Enable <15sec countdown between superset exercises
- **Rest period clarity**: Shows 60-90sec rest BETWEEN supersets (not between all exercises)
- **Time savings calculation**: Enables accurate time-saving visualization (30% faster than traditional)

## Progression Quality Standards

### ✅ Good Progressive Overload (demonstrated in all 9 workouts)
- Specific weight examples: "If Week 5 you squatted 155lbs×10, try 165lbs×10 or 155lbs×12"
- RPE context: "If Week 3 felt RPE 7 (easy), add 5-10lbs"
- Alternative progressions: "Add 5-10lbs OR 1-2 reps" (weight or volume)
- Fatigue auto-regulation: "Loads may be lighter Week 4 Thursday due to Monday's session—that's expected"

### ✅ Good Superset Structure (all 9 workouts)
- Clear superset pairing: Exercise A → Exercise B indicated in section titles
- Transition time goal: "<15sec transition between exercises" stated in notes
- Rest period clarity: "60-90sec rest after completing both exercises"
- Superset tagging: Consistent S1, S2, S3, S4, "" tagging

### ✅ Good Time-Efficiency Communication (all 9 workouts)
- Session time transparency: "Session time: ~30-35min" in descriptions
- Time savings explained: "30% faster than traditional training through supersets"
- Optional component framing: "Only add if time/energy allows—main supersets are priority"
- Flexible scheduling: "Any 3 non-consecutive days" philosophy demonstrated
