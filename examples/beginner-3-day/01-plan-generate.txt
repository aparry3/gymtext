# BEGINNER 3-DAY FULL-BODY TRAINING PLAN

## Client Profile
- **Name:** Sarah Chen
- **Age:** 28
- **Training Experience:** Complete beginner (6 months sedentary)
- **Goal:** Build strength foundation, improve body composition, establish consistent training habit
- **Schedule:** 3 days per week (Mon/Wed/Fri preferred)
- **Equipment Access:** Commercial gym (barbells, dumbbells, machines, cables)
- **Health Status:** Cleared by physician, no injuries or limitations

## Program Overview

This is a 12-week progressive full-body training program designed to build a solid strength foundation through compound movement patterns. Each session trains all major muscle groups using fundamental exercises that develop coordination, stability, and work capacity.

## Training Philosophy

**Foundation First:** Master basic movement patterns (squat, hinge, push, pull) with consistent form before adding significant load. Quality of movement trumps quantity of weight.

**Full-Body Efficiency:** Training all major muscle groups 3x/week maximizes frequency for skill acquisition and strength adaptation in beginners. Each session is a complete workout.

**Progressive Overload:** Gradual increases in volume and intensity drive adaptation. We'll add reps first, then sets, then load—ensuring sustainable progress without overwhelming recovery capacity.

**Sustainable Habits:** Three sessions per week is manageable long-term. Each workout is 45-60 minutes, allowing for life balance while building the training habit.

## Program Structure

**Duration:** 12 weeks (3 mesocycles × 4 weeks each)

**Frequency:** 3 sessions per week (non-consecutive days recommended)

**Session Format:**
- Warm-up (5-10 min): Movement prep and activation
- Main work (30-40 min): Compound strength exercises
- Accessory work (5-10 min): Isolation and stability
- Cooldown (5 min): Light stretching

**Session Types:**
All three weekly sessions follow the same template with slight exercise variations:
- **Day 1:** Squat focus, horizontal push/pull
- **Day 2:** Hinge focus, vertical push/pull  
- **Day 3:** Lunge focus, mixed push/pull angles

## Exercise Selection

**Core Movements (present every week):**
- Squat pattern: Goblet squat → DB goblet squat → Barbell back squat (introduced Week 5)
- Hinge pattern: DB Romanian deadlift → Barbell RDL → Conventional deadlift (introduced Week 7)
- Horizontal push: Push-up → DB bench press → Barbell bench press (introduced Week 5)
- Horizontal pull: Dumbbell row → Cable row
- Vertical push: DB shoulder press → Seated DB press
- Vertical pull: Lat pulldown → Assisted pull-up (introduced Week 9)
- Lunge pattern: Reverse lunge → Walking lunge → Bulgarian split squat (introduced Week 5)

**Accessory Movements:**

## Progression Scheme

### Phase 1: Movement Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
**Focus:** Learn movement patterns, establish consistency, build work capacity

**Rep Scheme:** 3 sets × 8-12 reps (RPE 6-7)
- Week 1: 3×8
- Week 2: 3×10
- Week 3: 3×12
- Week 4: Deload (2×10 at reduced intensity)

**Load Progression:** Add 5-10lbs when 3×12 is achieved with good form

**Notes:**
- Emphasis on tempo control (3-0-1: 3s eccentric, no pause, 1s concentric)
- Rest periods: 90-120s between sets
- All exercises performed with dumbbells or machines
- Coach demonstration and form feedback every session

### Phase 2: Strength Development (Weeks 5-8)
**Focus:** Introduce barbell movements, increase load, build strength base

**Rep Scheme:** 4 sets × 6-10 reps (RPE 7-8)
- Week 5: 4×6 (learning new barbell movements)
- Week 6: 4×8
- Week 7: 4×10  
- Week 8: Deload (3×8 at reduced intensity)

**Load Progression:** Add 5-10lbs when 4×10 is achieved with solid form

**Notes:**
- Barbell squat, bench press, and RDL introduced
- Rest periods: 2-3 min for main lifts, 90s for accessories
- Tempo: 2-0-1 for main lifts
- Focus shifts to progressive overload

### Phase 3: Consolidation & Testing (Weeks 9-12)
**Focus:** Solidify strength gains, test maximal capacity, prepare for next program

**Rep Scheme:** Progressive loading
- Week 9: 4×8 (RPE 8)
- Week 10: 5×5 (RPE 8-9, heavier loads)
- Week 11: 3×3 (RPE 9, testing strength)
- Week 12: Testing week (work up to 3-5 rep maxes, then active recovery)

**Load Progression:** Linear progression to test strength capacity

**Notes:**
- Introduce conventional deadlift
- Rest periods: 3-4 min for main lifts
- Final week includes strength testing for programming next phase
- Celebration of progress and goal review

## Intensity Guidelines

**RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion):**
- **RPE 6-7:** Moderate difficulty, could do 3-4 more reps
- **RPE 7-8:** Challenging, could do 2-3 more reps
- **RPE 8-9:** Hard, could do 1-2 more reps
- **RPE 9-10:** Maximal effort (rarely used in this program)

**Deload Weeks:**
- Every 4th week is a deload (Weeks 4, 8, 12)
- Reduce volume by ~40% (fewer sets)
- Reduce intensity by 10-20% (lighter weight)
- Maintain exercise selection and frequency
- Purpose: Recovery, adaptation, injury prevention

## Training Recommendations

**Warm-up Protocol:**
- 5 min light cardio (bike, row, or walk)
- Movement prep: cat-cow, world's greatest stretch, glute bridges
- Ramp sets: 2-3 light sets of main lift before working weight

**Rest Periods:**
- Phase 1: 90-120s between sets
- Phase 2-3: 2-3 min for main lifts, 90s for accessories
- Adjust based on recovery (longer if needed)

**Form Priorities:**
- Full range of motion on all exercises
- Controlled eccentric (lowering) phase
- Neutral spine maintained throughout
- Proper breathing (exhale on exertion)

**Recovery Between Sessions:**
- Minimum 1 rest day between training sessions
- 2 rest days after Week 3, 7, 11 (before deload/testing weeks)
- Active recovery encouraged: walking, light yoga, mobility work

## Metrics & Tracking

**Weekly Assessment:**
- Bodyweight (Monday AM, post-bathroom, pre-meal)
- Subjective energy level (1-10 scale)
- Sleep quality (hours + quality rating)
- Soreness/recovery status

**Exercise Log:**
- Weight used for each set
- Reps completed
- RPE rating
- Form notes/feedback from coach

**Progress Indicators:**
- Load lifted (primary metric)
- Reps completed at same weight
- Form quality improvement
- Reduced RPE at same load
- Body composition changes (monthly photos)

## Nutritional Guidance (General)

**Protein:** 1.6-2.0g per kg bodyweight daily
- Distribute across 3-4 meals
- Post-workout protein within 2 hours

**Hydration:** Minimum 2-3L water daily, more on training days

**Pre-Workout:** Light meal 1-2 hours before (carbs + protein)

**Post-Workout:** Recovery meal within 90 minutes (protein + carbs)

**Overall:** Slight caloric surplus (+200-300 cal/day) to support muscle growth and recovery. Adjust based on progress and goals.

## Expected Outcomes

**By Week 4:**
- Consistent training habit established (3x/week adherence)
- Movement patterns learned and refined
- Noticeable improvement in strength on all lifts (30-50% increases typical)
- Improved body awareness and coordination

**By Week 8:**
- Proficiency with barbell exercises (squat, bench, RDL)
- Significant strength gains (50-100% from baseline)
- Visible changes in body composition
- Increased confidence in gym environment

**By Week 12:**
- Solid strength foundation across all movement patterns
- 3-5 rep max established for major lifts (programming future phases)
- Sustained habit of consistent training
- Ready to progress to intermediate programming (4-5 day splits, specialization)

**Typical Strength Benchmarks (Sarah's goal by Week 12):**
- Barbell Back Squat: 135lbs × 5 reps
- Barbell Bench Press: 85lbs × 5 reps
- Barbell Romanian Deadlift: 135lbs × 5 reps
- Conventional Deadlift: 155lbs × 5 reps

## Troubleshooting & Modifications

**If sessions feel too easy:**
- Verify correct weight selection (should be RPE 7-8 by Week 2)
- Improve tempo control (slower eccentrics)
- Add 1 extra set to main lifts

**If recovery is poor:**
- Check sleep (minimum 7-8 hours)
- Assess nutrition (adequate protein and calories)
- Extend rest periods during session
- Add extra rest day between sessions

**If exercise causes pain:**
- Stop immediately and assess
- Substitute with similar movement pattern
- Reduce range of motion or load
- Consult coach or medical professional

**If missing sessions:**
- Resume with last completed workout
- Don't try to "make up" missed sessions
- Adjust weekly schedule as needed
- Minimum 2 sessions/week to maintain progress

## Next Steps After Program Completion

Upon completion of 12 weeks, Sarah will be assessed for:
1. Strength testing results and progress review
2. Goal reassessment and updated training objectives  
3. Program selection: upper/lower split (4x/week) or push/pull/legs (4-6x/week)
4. Introduction of advanced techniques: drop sets, tempo variations, paused reps
5. Potential specialization based on preferences (strength, hypertrophy, conditioning)

## Coach Notes

This program is designed to be beginner-friendly while delivering real results. The key is consistency and progressive overload—Sarah doesn't need to do anything fancy, just show up three times per week and gradually get stronger.

Form feedback is critical in Weeks 1-4. Don't rush load progression. Building proper movement patterns now prevents injuries and accelerates progress later.

Celebrate small wins—completing Week 1, hitting a new rep PR, mastering a new exercise. These build momentum and reinforce the habit.
