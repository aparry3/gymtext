# MICROCYCLE: WEEK 1 — Movement Foundation Phase

**Program:** Beginner 3-Day Full-Body Training Plan  
**Client:** Sarah Chen  
**Microcycle:** Week 1 of 12 (Phase 1: Movement Foundation)  
**Focus:** Learn movement patterns, establish baseline, build training habit  
**Volume:** 3 sessions × 9 working sets per session = 27 total sets  
**Intensity:** RPE 6-7 (moderate, technique-focused)

---

## Microcycle Overview

This is Sarah's first week of structured strength training. The primary goal is movement education and establishing consistent form across fundamental patterns. We're introducing 6 core movement patterns (squat, hinge, horizontal push/pull, vertical push/pull) and teaching her how to brace, breathe, and move through full range of motion.

All exercises use dumbbells or machines to allow for easier technique correction and lower injury risk. Weight selection is conservative—Sarah should finish each set feeling like she could do 3-4 more reps.

**Training Schedule:**
- Day 1 (Monday): Lower Focus + Horizontal Push/Pull
- Day 2 (Wednesday): Hinge Focus + Vertical Push/Pull
- Day 3 (Friday): Lunge Focus + Mixed Angles

**Recovery:** Minimum 1 rest day between sessions (active recovery encouraged: walking, light yoga, stretching)
