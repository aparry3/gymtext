# MICROCYCLE: WEEK 5 — Strength Development Phase

**Program:** Beginner 3-Day Full-Body Training Plan  
**Client:** Sarah Chen  
**Microcycle:** Week 5 of 12 (Phase 2: Strength Development — Week 1)  
**Focus:** Introduce barbell movements, increase load intensity, build strength foundation  
**Volume:** 3 sessions × 12-13 working sets per session = 37 total sets  
**Intensity:** RPE 7-8 (challenging loads with 2-3 reps in reserve)

---

## Microcycle Overview

Sarah has completed Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4) and demonstrated consistent technique across all fundamental movement patterns. Week 4 was a deload, so she's coming into Week 5 fresh and recovered. This microcycle marks a significant training shift: we're introducing barbell back squats and barbell bench press while increasing overall training intensity.

**Phase 2 Changes from Phase 1:**
- Barbell movements introduced (back squat, bench press)
- Lower reps (4×6 instead of 3×12) to focus on strength
- Heavier loads (RPE 7-8 instead of 6-7)
- Longer rest periods (2-3 min for main lifts)
- Increased total volume (4 sets instead of 3 for main lifts)

**Week 5 is a learning week:** The focus is on teaching Sarah proper barbell technique, not maxing out. We'll start with conservative weights and build confidence.

**Training Schedule:**
- Day 1 (Monday): Barbell Back Squat Introduction + Horizontal Push/Pull
- Day 2 (Wednesday): Hinge Focus + Vertical Push/Pull
- Day 3 (Friday): Lunge + Barbell Bench Press Introduction

**Recovery:** Continue minimum 1 rest day between sessions. Longer rest periods during session (2-3 min) mean sessions will be ~60 min.
