# MICROCYCLE: WEEK 9 — Consolidation & Testing Phase

**Program:** Beginner 3-Day Full-Body Training Plan  
**Client:** Sarah Chen  
**Microcycle:** Week 9 of 12 (Phase 3: Consolidation & Testing — Week 1)  
**Focus:** Consolidate strength gains, introduce heavier loads, test capacity  
**Volume:** 3 sessions × 15-16 working sets per session = 46 total sets  
**Intensity:** RPE 8-9 (heavy loads with 1-2 reps in reserve, approaching maximal)

---

## Microcycle Overview

Sarah has successfully completed Phases 1 and 2, demonstrating competency in all fundamental barbell movements and consistent progressive overload. Week 8 was a deload, so she's recovered and ready for the final push. Phase 3 shifts focus from skill acquisition to strength expression—we want to see how strong she's become.

**Phase 3 Changes from Phase 2:**
- Rep scheme: 4×8 → lower reps, heavier weight (testing)
- Conventional deadlift introduced (progressed from RDL)
- Assisted pull-ups introduced (progressed from lat pulldown)
- Higher intensity (RPE 8-9)
- Increased total sets (15-16 per session vs 12-13)
- Longer rest (3-4 min for main lifts)

**Week 9 Goals:**
- Test Sarah's improved work capacity with 4×8 at heavier loads
- Introduce conventional deadlift (full range hinge pattern)
- Introduce assisted pull-ups (vertical pulling progression)
- Build confidence for Week 11 strength testing (3×3 heavy)

**Training Schedule:**
- Day 1 (Monday): Squat + Horizontal Press/Pull
- Day 2 (Wednesday): Conventional Deadlift Introduction + Vertical Press/Pull
- Day 3 (Friday): Lunge + Bench Variation + Back Work

**Recovery:** Sessions are longer (~70 min) and more intense. Prioritize sleep (8+ hours), nutrition (protein + calories), and active recovery (walking, stretching).

## Week 10-12 Preview

**Week 10:** Continue 4×8 at heavy weights, minor weight increases (+5lbs where possible)

**Week 11 (Testing Week):** Shift to 3×3 at near-maximal loads (RPE 9-10). Goal: establish 3-rep maxes for squat, bench, deadlift, and OHP. This data informs next program cycle.

**Week 12 (Final Testing + Active Recovery):** Test 3-5 rep maxes early in week, then active recovery sessions (light movement, mobility, reflection on 12-week journey). Celebrate achievements and plan next phase.

**Estimated Strength Targets by Week 12:**
- Barbell back squat: 135lbs × 5 reps (goal achieved or exceeded likely)
- Barbell bench press: 85lbs × 5 reps (goal achieved or exceeded likely)
- Conventional deadlift: 155lbs × 5 reps (conservative first cycle)
- Barbell overhead press: 65lbs × 5 reps
