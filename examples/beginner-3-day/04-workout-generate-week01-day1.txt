# WORKOUT: Week 1, Day 1 — Squat Emphasis

**Program:** Beginner 3-Day Full-Body Training Plan  
**Client:** Sarah Chen  
**Week:** 1 of 12 (Phase 1: Movement Foundation)  
**Session:** Day 1 — Lower Focus + Horizontal Push/Pull  
**Date:** Monday, Week 1  
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Focus:** Introduce squat pattern, horizontal pressing and pulling movements

---

## Session Overview

This is Sarah's very first structured strength training session. The goal is to teach three fundamental movement patterns (squat, horizontal push, horizontal pull) while building confidence and establishing baseline strength. Weight selection is intentionally conservative—we want Sarah to finish feeling accomplished, not destroyed.

Every exercise will be coached with hands-on feedback. We'll film the first and third sets of each main lift for technique review. The session should feel moderately challenging but manageable, with Sarah leaving excited to come back for Day 2.

**Key Priorities:**
1. Teach proper breathing and bracing
2. Establish full range of motion on all exercises
3. Build confidence with weights
4. Set realistic expectations for soreness and recovery

---

## Warm-Up (8 minutes)

**Goal:** Raise core temperature, activate muscles, prepare movement patterns

**1. Light Cardio (5 minutes)**
- Treadmill walk at 3.0-3.5 mph with 0% incline
- OR stationary bike at easy resistance
- Conversational pace, no huffing or puffing
- Purpose: Get blood flowing, mentally transition into training

**2. Cat-Cow Stretch (10 reps)**
- On hands and knees, neutral spine to start
- Inhale: drop belly, lift chest (cow)
- Exhale: round spine, tuck chin (cat)
- Move slowly, breathe with each rep
- Purpose: Spinal mobility, breathing practice

**3. Glute Bridge (2 sets × 12 reps, 30s rest)**
- Lie on back, feet flat, knees bent
- Squeeze glutes and lift hips until body is straight from knees to shoulders
- Hold top position for 1 second, feel glutes working
- Lower with control, don't let hips touch ground between reps
- Purpose: Activate glutes before squatting, teach hip extension

**4. Goblet Squat Pattern Practice (2 sets × 8 reps, empty hands)**
- Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly out
- Hands at chest (imagine holding a goblet)
- Inhale and brace core, sit back into hips
- Squat down until hips below knees (or as deep as comfortable)
- Drive through midfoot to stand
- Purpose: Learn squat pattern without load, establish depth and bracing

## Main Work (32 minutes)

### Exercise 1: Goblet Squat — 3 sets × 8 reps

**Weight:** 15lbs dumbbell (single dumbbell held vertically at chest)  
**Rest:** 90 seconds between sets  
**Tempo:** 3-0-1 (3 seconds down, no pause at bottom, 1 second up)  
**RPE Target:** 6 (moderate effort, should feel like you could do 3-4 more reps)

**Setup:**
- Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointed slightly outward (10-15°)
- Hold dumbbell vertically at chest height, elbows pointing down
- Big breath in, brace core like someone's about to punch your stomach

**Execution:**
- Initiate movement by pushing hips back slightly, then bending knees
- Lower slowly (count to 3), keep chest proud and upright
- Elbows should track between knees at the bottom
- Bottom position: hips below knee height, weight on midfoot
- Drive through whole foot (not just toes) to stand
- Exhale at top, reset breath and brace for next rep

**Coaching Cues:**
- "Sit back into your hips first"
- "Chest stays up, elbows between knees"
- "Drive through the floor"
- "Squeeze glutes at the top"

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Knees caving inward (push knees out)
- Weight shifting to toes (stay on midfoot)
- Losing torso position (keep chest proud)
- Holding breath entire set (breathe between reps)

**Notes:**
- Film set 1 and set 3 for review
- If depth is limited by mobility, reduce range of motion
- 15lbs should feel easy for first few reps, moderate by rep 6-7

### Exercise 2: Dumbbell Bench Press — 3 sets × 8 reps

**Weight:** 15lbs per hand (two dumbbells)  
**Rest:** 90 seconds between sets  
**Tempo:** 3-0-1 (3 seconds down, light touch to chest level, 1 second press up)  
**RPE Target:** 6

**Setup:**
- Lie on flat bench, feet flat on floor, shoulder blades squeezed together
- Hold dumbbells at chest height, palms facing forward (away from face)
- Wrists straight, dumbbells directly over elbows and shoulders
- Slight arch in lower back (natural spinal position)

**Execution:**
- Press dumbbells up to full lockout, dumbbells should be over shoulders
- Lower dumbbells slowly (3 seconds), elbows at ~45° angle from body
- Lower until dumbbells are at chest level (don't let them drop past chest)
- Press back up explosively, exhale during press
- At top, dumbbells should nearly touch (but don't bang them together)

**Coaching Cues:**
- "Squeeze shoulder blades together and keep them there"
- "Lower slow, press fast"
- "Drive through the floor with your feet"
- "Full lockout at the top"

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Letting shoulder blades come apart (lose stability)
- Flaring elbows out to 90° (should be ~45°)
- Lowering dumbbells too far past chest (shoulder strain risk)
- Bouncing dumbbells off chest

**Notes:**
- Spotter available for all sets
- If Sarah struggles with set 3, reduce weight to 12lbs per hand
- Teach proper unracking and racking technique

### Exercise 3: Dumbbell Single-Arm Row — 3 sets × 8 reps each side

**Weight:** 20lbs dumbbell  
**Rest:** 60s per side (so 120s total before returning to same side)  
**Tempo:** 1-1-1 (1 second pull, 1 second squeeze, 1 second lower)  
**RPE Target:** 6

**Setup:**
- Place left hand and left knee on flat bench
- Right foot on ground, right hand holding dumbbell
- Back flat (neutral spine), torso parallel to ground
- Dumbbell hanging straight down from shoulder, arm fully extended

**Execution:**
- Initiate row by pulling elbow up and back toward hip
- Think about pulling elbow to ceiling, not just yanking weight up
- At top position, squeeze shoulder blade toward spine (1 second)
- Lower dumbbell with control until arm is fully extended
- Complete 8 reps on right side, then switch to left side

**Coaching Cues:**
- "Pull your elbow, not the weight"
- "Squeeze your shoulder blade at the top"
- "Keep your back flat like a table"
- "Don't twist your torso"

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Rotating torso (should stay stable, only arm moves)
- Shrugging shoulder up to ear (pull elbow back, not up)
- Using momentum to swing weight (controlled movement)
- Losing neutral spine (back should stay flat)

**Notes:**
- Do all 8 reps on one side before switching
- Rest 60s, then repeat on opposite side
- After completing both sides, rest 60s before next set

## Accessory Work (10 minutes)

### Exercise 4: Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift — 2 sets × 10 reps

**Weight:** 20lbs per hand  
**Rest:** 90 seconds between sets  
**Tempo:** 3-1-1 (3 seconds down, 1 second pause at stretch, 1 second up)  
**RPE Target:** 6

**Setup:**
- Stand tall with dumbbells at sides, palms facing thighs
- Feet hip-width apart, soft bend in knees
- Shoulders back, chest proud, neutral spine

**Execution:**
- Inhale and brace core
- Push hips back (imagine closing a car door with your butt)
- Lower dumbbells down front of legs, keeping them close to body
- Stop when you feel a strong stretch in hamstrings (usually mid-shin)
- Squeeze glutes to drive hips forward and return to standing
- Exhale at top

**Coaching Cues:**
- "Push your hips back, not down"
- "Feel the stretch in your hamstrings"
- "Chest stays proud the whole time"
- "Squeeze your glutes to stand up"

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Squatting down instead of hinging at hips
- Rounding lower back (maintain neutral spine)
- Bending knees too much (soft bend only)
- Letting dumbbells drift away from legs

**Notes:**
- This is a new movement pattern—spend extra time on setup
- Hamstring flexibility will limit depth—that's okay
- If Sarah can't reach mid-shin without rounding back, stop higher

### Exercise 5: Front Plank — 2 sets × 30 seconds

**Bodyweight only**  
**Rest:** 60 seconds between sets  
**RPE Target:** 7

**Setup:**
- Forearms on ground, elbows directly under shoulders
- Legs straight, toes on ground
- Body should form a straight line from head to heels

**Execution:**
- Brace core hard (like someone's about to punch your stomach)
- Squeeze glutes to prevent hips from sagging
- Pull shoulder blades apart slightly (don't let chest sag between shoulders)
- Breathe normally, don't hold breath
- Hold position for 30 seconds

**Coaching Cues:**
- "Squeeze your glutes the entire time"
- "Don't let your hips sag"
- "Breathe—don't hold your breath"
- "Pull your belly button toward your spine"

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Letting hips sag toward ground (most common error)
- Piking hips up too high
- Holding breath (causes dizziness)
- Letting head drop or crane neck

**Notes:**
- If 30s is too hard, drop to knees and hold modified plank
- If 30s is too easy, hold 45s next set
- Core should feel fatigued but not cramping

## Cooldown (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Bring heart rate down, start recovery process, reduce soreness

**1. Walk (2 minutes)**
- Easy pace around gym
- Bring breathing back to normal
- Mentally reflect on session

**2. Child's Pose (60 seconds)**
- Knees wide, sit hips back to heels, arms extended forward

- Purpose: Decompress spine, stretch hips and back

**3. Cat-Cow (10 reps)**
- Repeat warm-up movement
- Move slowly, breathe with each rep
- Purpose: Restore spinal mobility after training

**4. Hip Flexor Stretch (30 seconds each side)**
- Half-kneeling position (one knee on pad, opposite foot forward)
- Gently push hips forward until stretch in front of back hip
- Keep torso upright, don't lean forward
- Purpose: Stretch hip flexors after squatting

## Post-Session Notes

**What to Expect:**
- Soreness will peak 24-48 hours after session (DOMS is normal for beginners)
- Quads, glutes, chest, and upper back will likely be sore
- Soreness should be a "good" sore, not painful or sharp

**Recovery Recommendations:**
- Drink 16-20oz water immediately post-workout
- Eat a meal with protein within 2 hours (20-30g protein)
- Light activity tomorrow (walk 15-20 min) to promote blood flow
- Get 7-8 hours of sleep tonight

**Homework Before Day 2 (Wednesday):**
- Note any movements that felt awkward or uncomfortable
- Bring questions to next session
- Don't skip rest day tomorrow (Tuesday)

**Coach Reflection:**
- How did Sarah respond to the weight selection? Appropriate or too easy/hard?
- Did she grasp the movement patterns on first attempt?
- Any mobility limitations observed (ankle, hip, shoulder)?
- Confidence level coming in vs. leaving?
