# WORKOUT: Week 1, Day 2 — Hinge Emphasis

**Program:** Beginner 3-Day Full-Body Training Plan  
**Client:** Sarah Chen  
**Week:** 1 of 12 (Phase 1: Movement Foundation)  
**Session:** Day 2 — Hinge Focus + Vertical Push/Pull  
**Date:** Wednesday, Week 1  
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Focus:** Introduce hinge pattern (Romanian deadlift), vertical pressing and pulling

---

## Session Overview

Sarah's second-ever training session. Day 1 went well—she grasped the squat and horizontal press/pull patterns quickly. Today we're introducing the hip hinge (Romanian deadlift), which is often the most technically challenging pattern for beginners. We'll also teach vertical pressing (overhead) and vertical pulling (lat pulldown).

Sarah may have some residual soreness from Monday (DOMS), especially in quads and glutes. We'll check in on her recovery and adjust intensity if needed, but the schedule stays the same. Movement is the best recovery.

**Key Priorities:**
1. Teach proper hip hinge mechanics (RDL)
2. Build overhead pressing awareness (shoulder stability)
3. Introduce vertical pulling pattern (lat activation)
4. Reinforce breathing and bracing from Day 1

---

## Warm-Up (8 minutes)

**Goal:** Prepare hips and hamstrings for hinging, activate shoulders for pressing

**1. Light Cardio (5 minutes)**
- Stationary bike at easy resistance
- OR incline treadmill walk (3.0 mph, 3-5% incline)
- Purpose: Warm up legs and hips, increase blood flow to hamstrings

**2. World's Greatest Stretch (5 reps each side)**
- Start in push-up position
- Step right foot outside right hand
- Drop left knee to ground, sit hips back (feel hip flexor stretch)
- Rotate torso right, reach right arm to ceiling
- Return hand to ground, step back to push-up, repeat other side
- Purpose: Hip mobility, thoracic rotation, full-body warm-up

**3. Glute Bridge (2 sets × 12 reps, 30s rest)**
- Same as Day 1
- Focus on squeezing glutes at top, not just lifting hips
- Purpose: Activate glutes before hinging (glutes are key in RDL)

**4. Bodyweight Hinge Practice (2 sets × 8 reps)**
- Stand with hands on thighs
- Push hips back, slide hands down thighs toward knees
- Keep back flat, feel stretch in hamstrings
- Squeeze glutes to return to standing
- Purpose: Learn hinge pattern before adding weight

## Main Work (32 minutes)

### Exercise 1: Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift — 3 sets × 8 reps

**Weight:** 25lbs per hand (increased from accessory work on Day 1)  
**Rest:** 2 minutes between sets  
**Tempo:** 3-1-1 (3 seconds down, 1 second pause at stretch, 1 second up)  
**RPE Target:** 6-7 (this is the hardest movement today)

**Setup:**
- Stand with feet hip-width apart, dumbbells at sides
- Soft bend in knees (NOT a deep bend, just unlock knees)
- Shoulders back, chest proud, neutral spine
- Big breath, brace core

**Execution:**
- Initiate movement by pushing hips straight back (like closing car door with butt)
- Dumbbells slide down front of thighs, staying very close to legs
- Keep back flat (no rounding), feel stretch building in hamstrings
- Lower until you feel a strong hamstring stretch (usually mid-shin to knee)
- Pause 1 second at bottom stretch position
- Drive hips forward by squeezing glutes hard, return to standing
- Dumbbells stay close to body the entire time

**Coaching Cues:**
- "Push your hips BACK, not down"
- "Feel the stretch in your hamstrings, that's the goal"
- "Flat back the whole time—no rounding"
- "Squeeze your glutes to come up, don't pull with your back"

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Squatting down instead of hinging (knees should barely bend)
- Rounding lower back (maintain neutral spine)
- Letting dumbbells drift away from legs (should almost touch legs)
- Going too deep and losing spinal position (stop when back starts to round)

**Notes:**
- This is a NEW movement pattern—be patient with learning curve
- Sarah's hamstring flexibility will dictate depth (stopping at knee height is fine)
- Film all sets for technique review
- If form breaks down on set 3, reduce weight to 20lbs per hand
- Rest 2 minutes (longer than other exercises) because this is taxing

### Exercise 2: Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press — 3 sets × 8 reps

**Weight:** 12lbs per hand  
**Rest:** 90 seconds between sets  
**Tempo:** 2-0-1 (2 seconds down, no pause, 1 second press up)  
**RPE Target:** 6

**Setup:**
- Sit on bench with back support, feet flat on floor
- Hold dumbbells at shoulder height, palms facing forward
- Elbows slightly in front of shoulders (not directly out to sides)
- Shoulders back, chest up, core braced

**Execution:**
- Press dumbbells up and slightly back (not straight up)
- At top, dumbbells should be over shoulders or slightly behind head
- Arms fully extended at lockout (don't leave reps short)
- Lower dumbbells with control (2 seconds) back to shoulder height
- Elbows should drop to about ear level at bottom
- Exhale during press, inhale during lower

**Coaching Cues:**
- "Press up and slightly back"
- "Lock out at the top, arms fully straight"
- "Control the way down"
- "Keep your core tight—don't arch your back excessively"

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Pressing straight up (should be slight backward angle)
- Arching lower back excessively (core should stay braced)
- Not achieving full lockout at top
- Letting dumbbells drop too low (should stop at shoulder height)

**Notes:**
- Back support helps Sarah learn the movement without worrying about stability
- 12lbs should feel moderate—challenging by rep 6-7 but doable
- Watch for excessive lower back arch (sign of weak core or too much weight)

### Exercise 3: Lat Pulldown (Machine) — 3 sets × 10 reps

**Weight:** 50lbs  
**Rest:** 90 seconds between sets  
**Tempo:** 2-1-1 (2 seconds down, 1 second squeeze, 1 second return up)  
**RPE Target:** 6

**Setup:**
- Sit at lat pulldown machine, adjust thigh pad so knees are secure
- Grab bar with wide grip (hands wider than shoulders)
- Sit tall, chest up, slight lean back (~10-15°)
- Arms fully extended overhead

**Execution:**
- Initiate pull by driving elbows down and back toward ribs
- Pull bar down to upper chest (around clavicle level)
- Squeeze shoulder blades together at bottom (1 second hold)
- Think "pull elbows to your back pockets"
- Slowly return bar to starting position with control
- Maintain slight lean back throughout—don't rock back and forth

**Coaching Cues:**
- "Pull your elbows to your ribs"
- "Chest up to the bar, bar to your chest"
- "Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the bottom"
- "Slow and controlled on the way up"

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Pulling bar behind head (should come to front, upper chest)
- Using momentum/rocking back excessively (slight lean is fine)
- Not achieving full range at top (arms should be fully extended)
- Shrugging shoulders (keep shoulders down, pull with lats)

**Notes:**
- Lat pulldown teaches vertical pulling before pull-ups
- Sarah should feel this in her back, not just arms
- If she feels it only in biceps, cue "elbows back" more aggressively

## Accessory Work (10 minutes)

### Exercise 4: Goblet Squat — 2 sets × 10 reps

**Weight:** 20lbs dumbbell (increased from 15lbs on Day 1)  
**Rest:** 90 seconds between sets  
**Tempo:** 2-0-1 (slightly faster than Day 1)  
**RPE Target:** 6

**Setup & Execution:**
- Same as Day 1
- Increased weight to 20lbs since Sarah handled 15lbs well
- Faster tempo (2 seconds down vs 3) builds confidence and capacity

**Coaching Cues:**
- "Same as Monday, just a bit more weight"
- "Stay tight in the core"
- "Drive through the floor"

**Notes:**
- This is a sub-maximal squat day (main lift was RDL)
- Purpose: Maintain squat pattern without overloading legs
- Should feel easier than Day 1 since it's lighter relative intensity

### Exercise 5: Dumbbell Bicep Curl — 2 sets × 12 reps

**Weight:** 12lbs per hand  
**Rest:** 60 seconds between sets  
**Tempo:** 2-1-2 (2 seconds up, 1 second squeeze, 2 seconds down)  
**RPE Target:** 6

**Setup:**
- Stand with dumbbells at sides, palms facing forward
- Elbows pinned to sides (don't let them drift forward or back)
- Shoulders back, chest up

**Execution:**
- Curl dumbbells up, keeping elbows stationary at sides
- Squeeze biceps hard at top (1 second)
- Lower dumbbells slowly and with control (2 seconds)
- At bottom, arms fully extended (don't keep tension—go to full extension)
- Exhale on curl up, inhale on lower

**Coaching Cues:**
- "Elbows stay glued to your sides"
- "Squeeze at the top"
- "Slow on the way down, don't drop them"
- "Full range—bottom and top"

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Swinging weight (use strict form, no body English)
- Letting elbows drift forward (keep them pinned)
- Partial reps (full extension at bottom, full curl at top)

**Notes:**
- First isolation exercise Sarah has done
- Biceps get worked during rows and pulldowns, this is extra volume
- 12lbs should be challenging by rep 10-12

## Cooldown (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Stretch hamstrings and shoulders after hinge and pressing work

**1. Walk (2 minutes)**
- Easy pace, normalize breathing
- Shake out arms and legs

**2. Pigeon Pose (60 seconds each side)**
- Right shin on ground perpendicular to body, left leg extended back
- Sit hips down toward ground, feel stretch in right glute
- Hold 60s, switch sides
- Purpose: Hip opener, glute stretch after hinging

**3. Seated Hamstring Stretch (60 seconds)**
- Sit on ground, both legs extended in front
- Reach toward toes, keep back flat (don't round)
- Hold stretch, breathe deeply
- Purpose: Lengthen hamstrings after RDL work

## Post-Session Notes

**What to Expect:**
- Hamstrings and glutes will likely be sore tomorrow (RDL is new stimulus)
- Shoulders may be slightly sore from overhead pressing
- Soreness from Day 1 (quads) should be improving by now

**Recovery Recommendations:**
- Hydrate well (16-20oz post-workout)
- Protein within 2 hours (20-30g)
- Tomorrow (Thursday) is another rest day—walk 15-20 min
- Sleep 7-8 hours

**Homework Before Day 3 (Friday):**
- Reflect on how the hip hinge felt—awkward? Natural?
- Notice if hamstring soreness limits daily movement (bending over, stairs)
- Come ready to finish Week 1 strong!

**Coach Reflection:**
- Did Sarah understand the hinge cue? Pushing hips back vs. squatting down?
- Hamstring flexibility: did it limit her RDL depth significantly?
- Overhead pressing: any shoulder discomfort or stability issues?
- Energy level: is she recovering well between sessions?
