# WORKOUT: Week 1, Day 3 — Lunge Emphasis

**Program:** Beginner 3-Day Full-Body Training Plan  
**Client:** Sarah Chen  
**Week:** 1 of 12 (Phase 1: Movement Foundation)  
**Session:** Day 3 — Lunge Focus + Mixed Push/Pull Angles  
**Date:** Friday, Week 1  
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Focus:** Introduce single-leg pattern (reverse lunge), mixed pressing/pulling angles

---

## Session Overview

Final session of Sarah's first training week! This is a milestone—completing a full week of consistent training is a huge win for someone brand new to lifting. Today we're introducing the reverse lunge (single-leg pattern), an incline pressing angle, and cable rowing.

Sarah will likely have some lingering soreness from Days 1 and 2, especially hamstrings from Wednesday's Romanian deadlifts. This is normal and expected. The movement today will actually help with recovery by promoting blood flow.

This session should feel like a celebration of Week 1. The weight selection remains moderate, and we're not trying to set any records—just finish strong and build momentum for Week 2.

**Key Priorities:**
1. Teach single-leg stability (reverse lunge pattern)
2. Introduce incline pressing angle (upper chest emphasis)
3. Reinforce rowing pattern with cables (horizontal pull variation)
4. Celebrate completing Week 1!

## Warm-Up (8 minutes)

**Goal:** Prepare legs for single-leg work, activate hips for stability

**1. Light Cardio (3 minutes)**
- Light jog on treadmill (4.0-5.0 mph) OR jump rope
- If Sarah is too sore for jogging, use bike instead
- Purpose: Get heart rate up, warm up legs dynamically

**2. Leg Swings (10 reps each leg, each direction)**
- **Forward/Back:** Hold wall or rack for balance, swing right leg forward and back (10 reps), switch legs
- **Lateral (Side-to-Side):** Swing right leg across body left, then out to right (10 reps), switch legs
- Purpose: Hip mobility, dynamic warm-up for lunging

**3. Lateral Leg Swings (10 reps each leg)**
- Stand perpendicular to wall, swing outside leg side to side across body
- Purpose: Abductor and adductor activation for single-leg stability

**4. Bodyweight Reverse Lunge (2 sets × 6 each leg)**
- Stand tall, step right foot straight back
- Lower until both knees at 90° (back knee hovers above ground)
- Push through front (left) heel to return to standing
- Repeat with left foot stepping back
- Complete 6 reps each leg, rest 30s, repeat
- Purpose: Learn reverse lunge pattern without weight

## Main Work (32 minutes)

### Exercise 1: Dumbbell Reverse Lunge — 3 sets × 8 reps each leg

**Weight:** 15lbs per hand  
**Rest:** 90 seconds between sets (complete both legs before resting)  
**Tempo:** 2-0-2 (2 seconds down, no pause, 2 seconds up)  
**RPE Target:** 6-7 (balance challenge makes this harder than expected)

**Setup:**
- Stand tall with dumbbells at sides, palms facing inward
- Feet hip-width apart, weight evenly distributed
- Shoulders back, chest up, core braced

**Execution:**
- Step right foot straight back (about 2-3 feet)
- Lower body straight down until:
  - Front (left) knee at 90°, shin vertical
  - Back (right) knee hovers 1-2 inches above ground
- Both knees should be at 90° at the bottom
- Push through front heel to return to standing
- Bring feet back together at the top
- Alternate legs: 1 rep right, 1 rep left = 2 total reps
- Complete 8 reps per leg (16 total reps per set)

**Coaching Cues:**
- "Step straight back, not at an angle"
- "Lower straight down, both knees to 90°"
- "Push through your front heel, not your toes"
- "Stay tall—don't lean forward"

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Front knee caving inward (push knee out, track over toes)
- Leaning forward excessively (stay upright)
- Back foot too close or too far (adjust step distance for comfort)
- Slamming back knee into ground (control the descent)

**Notes:**
- First single-leg exercise—balance will be challenging
- It's okay to hold wall/rack with one hand for balance initially
- Reverse lunge is easier on knees than forward lunge (good beginner choice)
- If balance is a major issue, reduce weight to 10lbs per hand

### Exercise 2: Incline Dumbbell Bench Press — 3 sets × 8 reps

**Weight:** 12lbs per hand  
**Bench Angle:** 30-45° incline  
**Rest:** 90 seconds between sets  
**Tempo:** 3-0-1 (3 seconds down, touch chest, 1 second press up)  
**RPE Target:** 6

**Setup:**
- Adjust bench to 30-45° incline (lower than vertical, higher than flat)
- Sit on bench, feet flat on floor
- Hold dumbbells at chest height, palms facing forward
- Shoulder blades squeezed back against bench

**Execution:**
- Press dumbbells up to full lockout over shoulders
- Lower dumbbells slowly (3 seconds) to upper chest level
- Path should be slightly angled—pressing up and slightly back
- Dumbbells lower to sides of chest, elbows at ~45° from body
- Press back up explosively, exhale on press
- At top, dumbbells nearly touch but don't bang together

**Coaching Cues:**
- "Similar to Day 1 bench press, just on an incline"
- "Lower to upper chest, not lower chest"
- "Press up and slightly back"
- "Squeeze shoulder blades the whole time"

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Lowering dumbbells to lower chest (should be upper chest)
- Losing shoulder blade position (keep pinned to bench)
- Not achieving full lockout at top
- Flaring elbows out too wide (45° is optimal)

**Notes:**
- Incline targets upper chest and front shoulders more than flat bench
- 12lbs is appropriate for this angle (slightly easier than flat bench)
- Sarah should recognize the movement pattern from Day 1

### Exercise 3: Cable Seated Row — 3 sets × 10 reps

**Weight:** 60lbs  
**Rest:** 90 seconds between sets  
**Tempo:** 2-1-2 (2 seconds pull, 1 second squeeze, 2 seconds return)  
**RPE Target:** 6

**Setup:**
- Sit at cable row machine, feet on footplate
- Grab handle (V-grip or straight bar), arms fully extended
- Sit tall, chest up, slight lean back (~10°)
- Shoulders down and back

**Execution:**
- Pull handle to lower sternum/upper abs
- Drive elbows straight back (not out to sides)
- Squeeze shoulder blades together at end position (1 second hold)
- Slowly return weight forward with control
- Arms fully extend at the end, feel stretch in lats
- Maintain torso angle—don't rock back and forth excessively

**Coaching Cues:**
- "Pull the handle to your stomach"
- "Elbows drive straight back"
- "Squeeze your shoulder blades together"
- "Control it on the way back out"

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Rocking torso back and forth (slight movement okay, excessive is not)
- Pulling with arms only (should feel lats and mid-back working)
- Shrugging shoulders (keep them down and back)
- Letting arms bend early (initiate pull with back, not biceps)

**Notes:**
- This is similar to the dumbbell row from Day 1, just with cables
- Cable provides constant tension (feels different than dumbbells)
- Sarah should feel this in mid-back (between shoulder blades) and lats

## Accessory Work (10 minutes)

### Exercise 4: Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift — 2 sets × 10 reps

**Weight:** 25lbs per hand (same as Day 2 main work)  
**Rest:** 90 seconds between sets  
**Tempo:** 3-1-1 (3 seconds down, 1 second pause, 1 second up)  
**RPE Target:** 6

**Setup & Execution:**
- Same as Day 2
- Reinforcing the hinge pattern for the third time this week
- Sarah should feel more comfortable with this movement now

**Coaching Cues:**
- "You know this one—push hips back, flat back"
- "Feel the hamstring stretch"
- "Squeeze glutes to come up"

**Notes:**
- Third time doing RDL this week (Day 1 accessory, Day 2 main, Day 3 accessory)
- Repetition builds competency—Sarah should be improving each session
- Hamstrings may be sore, but movement will help recovery

### Exercise 5: Dumbbell Lateral Raise — 2 sets × 12 reps

**Weight:** 8lbs per hand  
**Rest:** 60 seconds between sets  
**Tempo:** 2-1-2 (2 seconds up, 1 second hold, 2 seconds down)  
**RPE Target:** 6

**Setup:**
- Stand with dumbbells at sides, palms facing inward
- Feet shoulder-width apart, slight bend in elbows
- Shoulders down and back, core braced

**Execution:**
- Raise dumbbells out to sides until arms are parallel to ground
- Lead with elbows, not hands (think "pouring water out of a pitcher")
- Slight bend in elbows throughout (not straight arms)
- Hold at top for 1 second (arms parallel to ground, shoulder height)
- Lower with control, don't drop dumbbells
- Stop just before dumbbells touch body, maintain tension

**Coaching Cues:**
- "Raise dumbbells to shoulder height"
- "Lead with your elbows"
- "Slight bend in elbows—not straight arms"
- "Control them on the way down"

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Shrugging shoulders up (keep shoulders down)
- Swinging weight (use strict form, no momentum)
- Raising dumbbells too high (stop at shoulder height)
- Straight arms (should have slight elbow bend)

**Notes:**
- First shoulder isolation exercise
- 8lbs is light but appropriate (lateral raises are hard with strict form)
- Sarah should feel this in side delts (side of shoulders)
- If 8lbs is too easy, increase to 10lbs next week

## Post-Session Notes

**Congratulations!**  
Sarah just completed her first full week of structured strength training. This is a HUGE accomplishment. Most people quit after 1-2 sessions. Finishing Week 1 means she's building the habit.

**What to Expect:**
- Peak soreness will hit this weekend (accumulated fatigue from 3 sessions)
- This is normal and will improve with consistency
- Monday (Day 1 of Week 2) might feel stiff, but moving will help

**Weekend Recovery Recommendations:**
- Saturday & Sunday: Light activity (20-30 min walk each day)
- Stay hydrated (80-100oz water daily)
- Eat adequate protein (1.6g per kg bodyweight daily)
- Get quality sleep (7-9 hours per night)
- Foam roll or light stretching if very sore

**Week 2 Preview:**
- Same exercises (building familiarity)
- Increase reps: 3×8 → 3×10
- Small weight increases on movements that felt too easy
- Goal: Build work capacity and refine technique

**Coach Reflection:**
- Energy level throughout week: high, moderate, or fading?
- Was Sarah able to complete all prescribed reps and sets?
- Movement competency: which patterns need more work (squat, hinge, lunge)?
- Confidence level: is she feeling more comfortable in the gym environment?
- Social/motivational factors: what kept her coming back this week?

**Sarah's Homework:**
1. Rest this weekend (active recovery only)
2. Reflect on Week 1: What felt good? What was challenging?
3. Set one goal for Week 2 (e.g., "Hit all 3 sessions again" or "Add 5lbs to goblet squat")
4. Celebrate this win—you did it!
