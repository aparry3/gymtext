# Beginner — General Fitness Foundation Examples

Reference examples for the Beginner training plan (3-day full body, 12 weeks).

## Plan Characteristics

- **Name:** Beginner — General Fitness Foundation
- **Split:** 3-Day Full Body (NASM Stabilization Endurance Phase)
- **Frequency:** 3 days/week (Mon/Wed/Fri typically)
- **Duration:** 12 weeks
- **Primary Focus:** Movement quality, stabilization, sustainable habit building
- **Progression:** Linear (form mastery → progressive overload → barbell introduction)
- **Target Audience:** New to structured training, building foundation

## Week Selection Rationale

**Week 1 (Form Mastery):**
- Establishes baseline with light loads (50-60% estimated 1RM)
- Focus: Learning movement patterns, slow tempo (3-1-1)
- Sets: 2-3 sets x 12-15 reps
- RPE: 5-6 (very light, prioritize perfect form)

**Week 5 (Progressive Overload Begins):**
- Mid-program volume increase
- Adds 5-10lbs when hitting 3x15 with clean form
- Sets: 3 sets x 12-15 reps  
- RPE: 6-7 (moderate, building confidence)
- Introduces tracking emphasis

**Week 9 (Barbell Introduction):**
- Transition to barbell lifts (squat, deadlift, bench press)
- Progressive introduction: one new barbell lift per day
- Sets: 3 sets x 10-12 reps
- RPE: 6-7 (focused on barbell technique)

## Key Programming Principles

1. **Form First:** Never sacrifice technique for weight
2. **Consistency Over Intensity:** 3x/week attendance more important than perfect sessions
3. **Recovery Awareness:** 7-9hr sleep, adequate protein (0.7-1g/lb bodyweight)
4. **Equipment Progression:** Dumbbells/machines → barbells by Week 9
5. **Deload Every 4th Week:** 40-50% volume reduction
6. **Patience:** Slow, steady progress builds foundation for years of training

## Comparison: Week 1 vs Week 9

| Dimension | Week 1 | Week 9 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Equipment | Dumbbells/machines | Barbells introduced |
| Load | 50-60% estimated 1RM | 60-70% 1RM |
| Tempo | 3-1-1 (strict control) | 2-0-1 (moderate) |
| RPE | 5-6 (very light) | 6-7 (moderate) |
| Sets | 2-3 | 3 |
| Tracking | Not emphasized | Emphasized |
| Exercise complexity | Basic patterns | Barbell compound lifts |

## Usage

These examples demonstrate:
- Full-body training structure for beginners
- Appropriate volume/intensity for new trainees
- Progressive introduction of complexity (dumbbells → barbells)
- Movement quality emphasis over load
- Realistic progression across 12 weeks
- Simple, sustainable programming
