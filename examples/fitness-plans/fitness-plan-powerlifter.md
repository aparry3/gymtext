# 16-Week USAPL Meet Prep

**Program Owner:** GymText
**User:** Chen
**Duration:** 16 weeks (2026-01-05 to 2026-04-26)
**Goal:** Break 900 lb total at USAPL Regional (June 13, 2026) — targets: 330 squat / 200 bench / 375 deadlift

## Program Philosophy
Chen is an advanced powerlifter with 3 meets under her belt and a clear 900 lb total goal on a fixed date. Programming is percentage-based with RPE as a secondary gauge, matching her preference. The plan uses classic linear periodization across three phases — accumulation (volume), intensification (intensity), and realization (peaking/taper). Two weak points drive accessory selection: bench lockout (board press, close-grip bench, pin press) and deadlift off the floor (deficit and paused deadlifts) — these are named specifically because they're coaching decisions, not interchangeable. Competition lifts (squat, bench, deadlift) are always performed to competition standard. Chen trains 4 days per week with Saturday as the heaviest session to simulate meet-day conditions. Weight class management is not a concern — she sits comfortably at 70.5 kg in the 72 kg class.

## Phase 1: Accumulation (Weeks 1-8)

### Weekly Pattern
#### Monday — Squat + Bench Accessories
**Focus:** Squat volume, bench lockout work.
**Volume:** ~18 sets

- Competition Squat: 4 × 5 @ 75% (RPE 7), progressing to 4 × 4 @ 78%
- Close-Grip Bench: 4 × 6 @ 70% of bench (RPE 7) — *lockout-specific pressing*
- Squat variation (SSB, tempo, belt squat, etc.): 3 × 6-8 (RPE 7-8) — *quad overload without wrist/shoulder stress*
- Board Press (2-board): 3 × 4-5 (RPE 7-8) — *targets lockout weakness specifically*
- Heavy row variation (barbell, cable, machine): 3 × 6-8 — *upper back for bench stability*

#### Tuesday — Bench + Deadlift Accessories
**Focus:** Bench volume, deadlift weak point work.
**Volume:** ~18 sets

- Competition Bench: 4 × 5 @ 75% (RPE 7), progressing to 4 × 4 @ 78%
- Deficit Deadlift (1"): 3 × 4-5 @ 70% of deadlift (RPE 7) — *strengthens position off floor*
- Pin Press (mid-chest height): 3 × 3-4 (RPE 7-8) — *lockout strength through sticking point*
- Paused Deadlift: 3 × 2-3 @ 70-75% — *position integrity off floor*
- Shoulder health work (lateral raises, face pulls, or similar): 2 × 15

#### Thursday — Squat Variation + Light Bench
**Focus:** Squat pattern variation for development, recovery-pace bench.
**Volume:** ~14 sets

- Pause Squat: 3 × 3-4 @ 70-73% (RPE 7)
- Bench variation with reduced leg drive (Larsen, feet-up, or similar): 3 × 6-8 @ 65% (RPE 6-7)
- Quad accessory (leg press, hack squat, etc.): 3 × 8-10
- Shoulder / upper back health work (face pulls, band pull-aparts, etc.): 3 × 15
- Core work (ab wheel, hanging leg raise, etc.): 2 × 10-12

#### Saturday — Competition Day Simulation
**Focus:** Heavy top sets in competition order (squat → bench → deadlift).
**Volume:** ~14-16 sets

- Competition Squat: Work to 1 × 2-3 @ 80-85% (RPE 8-8.5)
- Competition Bench: Work to 1 × 2-3 @ 80-85% (RPE 8-8.5)
- Competition Deadlift: Work to 1 × 2-3 @ 80-85% (RPE 8-8.5)
- Row variation: 3 × 5-6
- Tricep accessory (dips, pushdowns, or similar): 2 × 8

### Progression Strategy
Two 4-week sub-blocks within this phase:
- **Weeks 1-3:** Establish working weights at prescribed percentages. Add 5 lb/week to competition lifts. Saturday triples at 80%.
- **Week 4:** Push final heavy session. Accumulated fatigue expected.
- **Week 5:** Deload — drop volume 40%, keep intensity at 80%.
- **Weeks 6-8:** Resume at higher percentages (78% base). Saturday progresses to doubles at 85%. Push accessory PRs.

## Phase 2: Intensification (Weeks 9-12)

### Weekly Pattern
#### Monday — Squat + Bench Accessories
**Focus:** Heavier squat triples, reduced accessory volume.
**Volume:** ~14 sets

- Competition Squat: 5 × 3 @ 83% (RPE 8-8.5)
- Close-Grip Bench: 3 × 4 @ 78% (RPE 8)
- Board Press (2-board): 3 × 3 (RPE 8-9) — *heavier lockout work*
- Row variation: 3 × 5

#### Tuesday — Bench + Deadlift
**Focus:** Heavy bench triples, competition deadlift takes over from deficit work.
**Volume:** ~14 sets

- Competition Bench: 5 × 3 @ 83% (RPE 8-8.5)
- Competition Deadlift: 4 × 2 @ 83% (RPE 8)
- Deficit Deadlift: 2 × 3 @ 75% (RPE 7) — *maintenance dose only*
- Shoulder health work: 2 × 12

#### Thursday — Technique & Recovery
**Focus:** Light technique work. Nothing should be a grinder.
**Volume:** ~10 sets

- Pause Squat: 3 × 2 @ 75% (RPE 7)
- Bench variation with tempo or pause emphasis (Spoto, tempo, etc.): 3 × 4 @ 70% (RPE 6-7)
- Upper back / shoulder health work: 2 × 15
- Core work: 2 × 10

#### Saturday — Heavy Singles
**Focus:** Singles at meet-relevant intensities. Practice commands.
**Volume:** ~10 sets

- Competition Squat: Work to 1 × 1 @ 90% (RPE 8.5-9)
- Competition Bench: Work to 1 × 1 @ 90% (RPE 8.5-9)
- Competition Deadlift: Work to 1 × 1 @ 90% (RPE 8.5-9)
- Light row variation: 2 × 8

### Progression Strategy
- **Week 9:** Shift to triples on main days, singles on Saturday. RPE 8-8.5.
- **Week 10:** Add 5 lb to Saturday singles. Triples stay at same weight — focus on bar speed.
- **Week 11:** Push Saturday singles to 92-93%. RPE may hit 9. Last truly hard week.
- **Week 12:** Deload — 50% volume, 80% intensity. Full recovery before peaking.

## Phase 3: Realization & Taper (Weeks 13-16)

### Weekly Pattern
#### Monday — Openers Practice
**Focus:** Practice planned opening attempts. Should feel smooth and fast.

- Competition Bench: Work to opener (180 lb) × 1 (RPE 7-8)
- Light row variation: 2 × 8
- Band work (pull-aparts, face pulls, etc.): 2 × 20

#### Tuesday — Deadlift Opener + Light Bench
**Focus:** Deadlift opener practice, bench maintenance.
**Volume:** ~8 sets

- Competition Deadlift: Work to opener (345 lb) × 1 (RPE 7-8)
- Light bench variation: 2 × 5 @ 60% (RPE 6)
- Shoulder health work: 2 × 15

#### Thursday — Light Technique (Weeks 13-14 only)

**Volume:** 9 singles

- Squat: 310 / 325 / 330
- Bench: 180 / 190 / 200
- Deadlift: 345 / 365 / 375

### Taper Strategy
- **Week 13:** Practice openers. If opener RPE exceeds 8, reduce by 5 lb.
- **Week 14:** Full meet simulation on Saturday. Assess attempt selection. Adjust 2nd/3rd attempts if needed.
- **Week 15:** Two sessions only (Mon/Tue). Openers at 90% effort. Drop all accessories.
- **Week 16:** Meet week. Monday: light singles at 50-60% for bar feel only. No training Tue-Fri. Saturday: compete.

## Attempt Selection Strategy
| Lift | Opener | 2nd Attempt | 3rd Attempt |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Squat | 310 lb (98% of meet PR) | 325 lb | 330 lb (target) |
| Bench | 180 lb (97% of meet PR) | 190 lb | 200 lb (target) |
| Deadlift | 345 lb (95% of meet PR) | 365 lb | 375 lb (target) |
| **Total** | **835 lb** | **880 lb** | **905 lb (target)** |

**Rules:**
- Openers must be RPE 7-8 — they build confidence and secure a total
- 2nd attempts are the "plan" — should be achievable on a normal day
- 3rd attempts are the "reach" — only if 2nd attempt moved well
- If opener feels heavy (RPE 9+), take a conservative 2nd and reassess

## Modification History
- **2026-02-14:** Board press PR (200 × 3) — lockout strength improving. Deficit deadlift carryover visible in faster floor speed.
- **2026-02-07:** Deload week executed as planned (Week 5). Reduced volume 40%, kept intensity at 80%. Recovery was needed — knees and elbows were getting cranky.
- **2026-01-05:** Meet prep plan created. Identified bench lockout and deadlift off-floor as primary weak points. Added board press, close-grip bench, pin press, deficit deadlift, and paused deadlift as targeted accessories.
