# Marathon Supplemental Strength

**Program Owner:** GymText
**User:** David
**Goal:** Injury prevention and strength maintenance for marathon training. Current target: Boston qualifier (April 2026, 3:05)

## Program Philosophy
David is an experienced runner targeting a Boston qualifier but a novice lifter. Lifting serves his running — never the other way around. Sessions are short (30-45 min), scheduled on easy run days (Mon/Wed/Fri) to avoid interfering with quality running sessions. The program prioritizes glute and hip strength (addressing his IT band history), single-leg stability (running is a single-leg sport), and core anti-rotation/anti-extension work. Loading progresses conservatively — volume before intensity — because accumulated lower body fatigue cannot compromise running gait or weekly mileage. Supersets keep sessions efficient. Every exercise has an injury-prevention rationale. Friday is always the lightest session to protect Saturday's long run.

## Phase 1: Foundation

### Weekly Pattern
#### Monday — Hip & Posterior Chain
**Focus:** Glute activation, hip stability, posterior chain strength.
**Volume:** ~12 sets

- Hip hinge (RDL or similar): 3 × 8 (RPE 6-7)
- Squat pattern (goblet or similar): 3 × 10 (RPE 6-7)
- Single-leg glute work (bridge, kickback, etc.): 2 × 12 each — *glute medius activation for IT band stability*
- Anti-rotation core (Pallof press or similar): 2 × 10 each side — *running posture*
- Hip abductor activation (band walks, clamshells, etc.): 2 × 15 each — *lateral hip stability*

#### Wednesday — Single-Leg & Upper Pull
**Focus:** Unilateral strength and balance. Running is single-leg — train that way. Upper body pulling for posture.
**Volume:** ~12 sets

- Single-leg hip hinge (single-leg RDL or similar): 3 × 8 each (RPE 6-7)
- Single-leg squat pattern (step-up, split squat, etc.): 3 × 8 each (RPE 6-7)
- Upper body pull (pull-up, row, etc.): 2 × max or 2 × 10 — *upper back posture and late-race form*
- Core stability (dead bug, bird dog, etc.): 2 × 10 each side
- Adductor strengthening (Copenhagen plank or similar): 2 × 20 sec each side — *knee stability*

#### Friday — Light Full Body
**Focus:** Lightest session of the week. Upper body gets most of the focus here — long run tomorrow, protect the legs.
**Volume:** ~10 sets

- Upper body press (bench, push-up, OHP): 3 × 10 (RPE 6)
- Upper back / posture work (face pulls, band pull-aparts): 2 × 15
- Deadlift variation (trap bar or conventional, light): 2 × 6 (RPE 6) — *maintain hip hinge pattern without fatiguing legs*
- Plank or carry: 2 × 45 sec

### Progression Strategy
Repeat for 3-4 week cycles:
- **Weeks 1-2:** Establish baseline weights. Everything RPE 6 max. Prioritize movement quality.
- **Week 3:** Add 5 lb to hip hinge movements if RPE allows. Add reps to accessories.
- **Week 4:** Deload — 2 sets per exercise, 60% of working weight. Prioritize mobility.

Transition to Build phase when movement patterns are solid and RPE consistently below target.

## Phase 2: Build

### Weekly Pattern
Same session structure as Foundation. Key changes:

#### Monday — Hip & Posterior Chain
- Hip hinge: 3 × 8 (RPE 7)
- Squat pattern: 3 × 10 (RPE 7)
- Add a third set to single-leg glute work: 3 × 10 each
- Anti-rotation core: 2 × 12 each side
- Hip abductor work: maintain

#### Wednesday — Single-Leg & Upper Pull
- Single-leg hip hinge: 3 × 8 each (RPE 7)
- Single-leg squat pattern: 3 × 8 each (RPE 7)
- Upper body pull: add a third set
- Adductor work: progress to 2 × 30 sec each side
- Core: progress to weighted or more challenging variation

#### Friday — Light Full Body
- Upper body press: 3 × 12-15
- Upper back work: maintain
- Deadlift variation: 2 × 5 (RPE 7) — keep volume low, protect long run
- Plank or carry: progress duration or add weight

### Progression Strategy
- **Weeks 1-2:** Reset at slightly heavier weights. RPE target 7.
- **Week 3:** Push top sets to RPE 7.5. Monitor for any running fatigue spillover — if runs feel heavy, back off gym weights.
- **Week 4:** Deload — align with a running step-back week when possible.

Stay in Build phase as long as running mileage is building. Do not increase gym intensity during peak mileage weeks.

## Phase 3: Maintain

### Weekly Pattern
Same three-day structure. Volume drops slightly — running is the priority now.

#### Monday — Hip & Posterior Chain
**Volume:** ~10 sets
- Hip hinge: 3 × 6 (RPE 7) — hold weight, fewer reps
- Squat pattern: 3 × 8 (RPE 7)
- Single-leg glute work: 2 × 10 each
- Core: 2 × 10 each side

#### Wednesday — Single-Leg & Upper Pull
**Volume:** ~10 sets
- Single-leg hip hinge: 3 × 8 each (RPE 7) — hold weight
- Single-leg squat pattern: 3 × 8 each (RPE 7)
- Upper body pull: 2-3 × max reps
- Adductor work: maintain

#### Friday — Light Full Body
**Volume:** ~8 sets
- Upper body press: 2 × 10 (RPE 6)
- Posture work: 2 × 15
- Deadlift variation: 2 × 5 (RPE 6-7) — reduce volume, protect long run
- Plank: 2 × 60 sec

### Progression Strategy
- Hold weights steady. Do not increase load during this phase.
- If weekly running mileage exceeds 50 miles or a workout feels heavy, drop a set from each exercise.
- Stay in Maintain through peak mileage and race-specific training blocks.

## Phase 4: Taper (Event-Specific)
Only enters this phase when approaching a target race.

#### Monday & Wednesday — Abbreviated Sessions
**Volume:** ~8 sets per session
- Squat pattern: 2 × 6 (RPE 6)
- Single-leg hip hinge: 2 × 6 each (RPE 6)
- Glute activation: 2 × 10
- Core: 1 × 60 sec

#### Friday — Drop or replace with mobility
No lifting in final 2 weeks before race. Foam rolling and activation drills only.

### Taper Strategy
- 4 weeks out: Cut volume to 60% of Maintain. Hold weight on bar.
- 3 weeks out: Cut volume to 40%. Last moderate session.
- 2 weeks out: 2 sessions only (Mon/Wed), very light activation.
- Race week: No lifting. Light mobility and activation drills only.

After the race, return to Foundation or Build phase depending on fitness level and next training block.

## Phase Cycling
Outside of event-specific taper, this program cycles: Foundation → Build → Maintain → (repeat). The transition between phases is driven by running training state — when mileage is building, stay in Build or Maintain. During off-season or base-building, return to Foundation to progress strength. There is no fixed program duration.

## Modification History
- **2026-02-17:** Kept lower body volume conservative during peak mileage week (52 miles). IT band holding up.
- **2026-02-10:** Added Copenhagen plank for adductor strength after positive feedback on hip work.
- **2026-01-20:** Reduced lifting volume during recovery week following IT band flare-up. Added targeted hip/glute activation work to pre-run routine.
