# Upper/Lower Strength & Hypertrophy

**Program Owner:** GymText
**User:** Alex Martinez
**Goal:** Build muscle, improve compound strength, lose 10 lbs body fat

## Program Philosophy
Alex is an intermediate lifter with 2 years of consistent training and solid baseline strength. A 4-day upper/lower split maximizes his available training days (Mon/Wed/Fri/Sat) while allowing adequate recovery. The program alternates between strength-focused and hypertrophy-focused sessions — upper strength and lower strength early in the week, upper hypertrophy and lower hypertrophy on the back half. Compound movements drive progression while accessory selection rotates for variety (per Alex's preference). Barbell squats are currently replaced with knee-friendly squat variations (goblet, front squat) due to active knee discomfort. Short rest periods and supersets on hypertrophy days support his body composition goal without dedicated steady-state cardio.

## Phase 1: Accumulation

### Weekly Pattern
#### Monday — Upper Strength
**Focus:** Heavy horizontal press and horizontal pull. Build top-end pressing strength.
**Volume:** ~16 sets

- Heavy horizontal press: 4 × 5 (RPE 7-8)
- Heavy horizontal pull: 4 × 6 (RPE 7-8)
- Vertical press: 3 × 8 (RPE 7)
- Vertical pull (weighted): 3 × 6 (RPE 7-8)
- Rear delt / rotator cuff: 2 × 15

#### Wednesday — Lower Strength
**Focus:** Knee-dominant and hip-dominant compounds. Use goblet or front squat variations (no barbell back squat — active knee constraint).
**Volume:** ~14 sets

- Knee-dominant squat variation (goblet/front): 4 × 8 (RPE 7-8)
- Hip hinge: 4 × 6 (RPE 7-8)
- Single-leg movement: 3 × 10 each
- Hamstring isolation: 3 × 10

#### Friday — Upper Hypertrophy
**Focus:** Volume accumulation for chest, back, shoulders, arms. Rotate exercise selection for variety.
**Volume:** ~18 sets

- Incline press variation: 4 × 10 (RPE 7)
- Cable/machine row variation: 4 × 10 (RPE 7)
- Lateral raise variation: 3 × 12
- Bicep curl variation: 3 × 12
- Tricep isolation: 3 × 12
- Chest fly (cable or band): 2 × 15

#### Saturday — Lower Hypertrophy
**Focus:** Volume, single-leg work, posterior chain. Can use full commercial gym equipment.
**Volume:** ~16 sets

- Front-loaded squat variation: 4 × 8 (RPE 7)
- Deadlift or heavy hip hinge: 3 × 5 (RPE 7-8)
- Single-leg squat pattern (split squat, lunge, etc.): 3 × 10 each
- Glute-dominant movement: 3 × 10
- Calf raises: 3 × 15

### Progression Strategy
Repeat this phase for 3-4 weeks per cycle:
- **Weeks 1-2:** Establish working weights at prescribed RPE. Add 5 lb to barbell compounds week-over-week if RPE is at or below target.
- **Week 3:** Add reps to accessory movements OR small weight jumps. Push compounds to top of RPE range.
- **Week 4:** Deload — reduce working weights 40%, keep volume at 2 sets per exercise. Movement quality focus.

After 2-3 accumulation cycles, transition to Intensification when compound lifts plateau or Alex is ready for heavier loading.

## Phase 2: Intensification

### Weekly Pattern
#### Monday — Upper Strength
**Focus:** Heavier pressing, lower rep ranges.
**Volume:** ~16 sets

- Heavy horizontal press: 5 × 4 (RPE 8-9)
- Heavy row variation: 4 × 5 (RPE 8)
- Close-grip or tricep-dominant press: 3 × 6
- Weighted pull-up or chin-up: 3 × 5 (RPE 8)
- Band work for shoulder health: 2 × 20

#### Wednesday — Lower Strength
**Focus:** Heavier squat variation, deadlift emphasis.
**Volume:** ~14 sets

- Knee-dominant squat variation: 4 × 6 (RPE 8-9)
- Deadlift variation: 4 × 4 (RPE 8-9)
- Step-up or lunge pattern: 3 × 8 each
- Hamstring curl variation: 3 × 8

#### Friday — Upper Hypertrophy
**Focus:** Moderate loads, pump work, exercise rotation.
**Volume:** ~18 sets

- Dumbbell or machine press: 4 × 8 (RPE 7-8)
- Seated row variation: 4 × 10 (RPE 7)
- Shoulder press variation: 3 × 10
- Bicep variation: 3 × 10
- Tricep variation: 3 × 10
- Rear delt work: 2 × 15

#### Saturday — Lower Hypertrophy
**Focus:** Single-leg strength, posterior chain volume.
**Volume:** ~16 sets

- Front-loaded squat variation: 4 × 6 (RPE 8)
- Hip hinge: 3 × 8 (RPE 7-8)
- Reverse lunge or single-leg pattern: 3 × 10 each
- Glute bridge or thrust: 3 × 12
- Calf raises: 3 × 12

### Progression Strategy
Repeat for 3-4 weeks per cycle:
- **Weeks 1-2:** Reset at new working weights based on accumulation gains. Target RPE 8 on compounds, add 5 lb week-over-week.
- **Week 3:** Push final sets to RPE 9 on compounds. Hold accessories steady.
- **Week 4:** Deload — 50% volume, 75% intensity.

Transition to Realization after 1-2 intensification cycles, or cycle back to Accumulation if Alex wants more volume work.

## Phase 3: Realization

### Weekly Pattern
#### Monday — Upper Strength
**Focus:** Peak pressing strength. Heavy triples and singles.
**Volume:** ~14 sets

- Heavy horizontal press: 3 × 3, then 2 × 1 (RPE 8-9.5)
- Heavy row: 4 × 5 (RPE 8)
- Vertical press: 3 × 5 (RPE 8)
- Pull-ups: 3 × max reps

#### Wednesday — Lower Strength
**Focus:** Peak lower body strength.
**Volume:** ~12 sets

- Squat variation: 3 × 5, then 2 × 3 (RPE 8-9)
- Deadlift: 3 × 3, then 1 × 1 (RPE 9)
- Single-leg movement: 3 × 6 each
- Hamstring work: 2 × 10

#### Friday — Upper Volume (Moderate)
**Focus:** Maintain muscle, moderate effort. No grinders.
**Volume:** ~14 sets

- Press variation: 3 × 8 (RPE 7)
- Row variation: 3 × 10 (RPE 7)
- Lateral raise: 3 × 12
- Arm superset: 2 × 12 each

#### Saturday — Lower Volume (Moderate)
**Focus:** Movement quality, moderate load.
**Volume:** ~12 sets

- Squat variation: 3 × 6 (RPE 7)
- Hip hinge: 3 × 8 (RPE 7)
- Glute work: 3 × 10
- Calf raises: 3 × 12

### Progression Strategy
- **Weeks 1-2:** Work up to heavy triples on main lifts. Accessories stay moderate.
- **Week 3:** Attempt new rep maxes — singles at RPE 9 on main compounds.
- **Week 4:** Test week or back-off week, then cycle back to Accumulation Phase 1.

## Phase Cycling
This program repeats: Accumulation → Intensification → Realization → restart. Each full cycle runs roughly 10-16 weeks depending on how many mini-cycles are spent in each phase. There is no fixed end date — Alex continues cycling until goals shift.

## Modification History
- **2026-02-16:** Replaced barbell back squat with goblet squat and front squat variations across all phases due to knee discomfort. Monitoring — will reintroduce barbell squat if discomfort resolves.
- **2026-01-15:** Added accessory rotation per user feedback — wants more variety. Plan now specifies movement patterns rather than fixed exercises for accessories.
