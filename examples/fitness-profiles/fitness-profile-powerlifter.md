# IDENTITY
**Name:** Chen
**Age:** 29
**Gender:** Female
**Experience:** Advanced (4 years powerlifting, 3 meets competed)
**Weight Class:** 72 kg / 158.7 lb

# GOALS
- **Primary:** Break 900 lb total at next meet (currently 865 lb best)
- **Meet:** USAPL Regional — June 13, 2026 (~16 weeks out)
- **Lift targets:** 330 squat (+15) / 200 bench (+15) / 375 deadlift (+10)
- **Secondary:** Fix bench lockout weakness, improve deadlift start position

# TRAINING CONTEXT

## Schedule & Availability
- **Days:** Mon, Tue, Thu, Sat
- **Duration:** Up to 2 hours for heavy sessions
- **Competition day:** Sat is heaviest session (simulates meet conditions)

## Equipment & Environment
- **Powerlifting gym:** Calibrated plates, competition bench/bars, mono-lift, specialty bars (SSB, cambered), bands, chains
- **Competition gear:** SBD belt, SBD knee sleeves, A7 singlet

## Constraints
- [ACTIVE] Bench lockout is weak point — triceps and upper back lag behind chest off the chest. Addressing with board press, close-grip bench, and pin press (since 2026-01-05)
- [ACTIVE] Deadlift breaks floor slowly — weak off the ground, strong at lockout. Addressing with deficit deadlifts and paused deadlifts (since 2026-01-05)
- Must stay within 72 kg class — currently sitting at 70.5 kg, no issues
- As a PT, very aware of movement quality — will flag form breakdown early

## Preferences
- Likes: percentage-based programming, RPE as secondary gauge
- Dislikes: high-rep "fluff" work, prefers quality over volume
- Wants to understand the periodization rationale
- Prefers conjugate-influenced accessory selection with linear main lift progression
- Warm-up: specific — bar work, light singles at increasing percentages
