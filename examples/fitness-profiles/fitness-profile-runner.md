# IDENTITY
**Name:** David
**Age:** 42
**Gender:** Male
**Experience:** Novice lifter (6 months), experienced runner (10 years, 5 marathons)

# GOALS
- **Primary:** Injury prevention — history of IT band syndrome and runner's knee
- **Secondary:** Maintain muscle mass during marathon training, improve running economy
- **Event:** Boston Marathon qualifier attempt (April 2026, target 3:05)

# TRAINING CONTEXT

## Schedule & Availability
- **Lifting days:** Mon, Wed, Fri (easy run days)
- **Running:** 5 days/week (40-50 mi/week base)
- **Long run:** Saturday mornings
- **Rest:** Sunday
- **Duration:** 30-45 min lifting (running is priority)

## Equipment & Environment
- **Commercial gym:** Full access (barbells, machines, cables)
- **Outdoor:** Regular running routes, local track for speed work

## Constraints
- [ACTIVE] IT band tightness on left side — flares during high mileage weeks. Foam rolling + hip strengthening protocol in place (since 2026-01-20)
- [RESOLVED] Runner's knee, right side (2025-03) — resolved with quad/glute strengthening
- Lifting must never compromise run quality — no heavy leg work before long runs or tempo days
- Cannot accumulate lower body fatigue that affects running gait

## Preferences
- Likes: efficient full-body sessions, supersets to save time
- Dislikes: bodybuilding-style isolation work, long gym sessions
- Focus areas: glutes, hips, core, single-leg stability
- Style: wants to understand injury prevention rationale behind exercises
