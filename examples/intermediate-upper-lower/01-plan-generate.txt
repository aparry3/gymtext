# INTERMEDIATE UPPER/LOWER SPLIT TRAINING PLAN

## Client Profile
- **Name:** Marcus Johnson
- **Age:** 32
- **Training Experience:** 2 years consistent training (completed beginner program)
- **Current Lifts:** Squat 275lbs × 5, Bench 225lbs × 5, Deadlift 315lbs × 5
- **Goal:** Continue strength and muscle development, break through intermediate plateau
- **Schedule:** 4 days per week (Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri preferred)
- **Equipment Access:** Fully equipped gym (barbells, machines, cables, dumbbells)
- **Health Status:** No injuries, cleared for intensive training

## Program Overview

This is a 16-week block-periodized upper/lower split designed for intermediate lifters who have exhausted linear progression and need more sophisticated programming. The split allows higher training frequency (each muscle group trained 2x/week) while managing fatigue through strategic exercise selection and volume manipulation.

**Why Upper/Lower for Intermediates:**
- Increased training frequency (2x/week per muscle group) drives better adaptations than once-weekly splits
- Allows accumulation of higher volumes than full-body training
- Exercise variation between Upper 1/2 and Lower 1/2 prevents staleness and overuse
- Easier to recover from than daily body-part splits
- Flexible enough to accommodate life/work schedule

## Training Philosophy

**Frequency Over Intensity:** Hitting muscles 2x/week with moderate volume per session beats crushing them once with excessive volume. Recovery happens between sessions.

**Block Periodization:** Training is organized into focused blocks, each with a specific adaptation goal. Blocks build on each other rather than trying to do everything simultaneously.

**Variation for Adaptation:** Upper 1 and Upper 2 use different exercises/rep schemes for the same muscle groups. This provides novel stimuli while managing fatigue.

**Auto-Regulation:** RPE and RIR targets allow adjustment based on daily readiness. Not every session needs to be maximal.

## Program Structure

**Duration:** 16 weeks (4 blocks × 4 weeks each)

**Frequency:** 4 sessions per week

## Exercise Selection Principles

**Movement Pairs:** Upper 1/2 and Lower 1/2 use different exercises for the same patterns
- Upper 1: Flat bench press → Upper 2: Overhead press
- Upper 1: BB row → Upper 2: Pull-up
- Lower 1: Back squat → Lower 2: Front squat
- Lower 1: RDL → Lower 2: Conventional deadlift

**Variation Rationale:**
- Different loading vectors prevent overuse injuries
- Novel stimuli drive continued adaptation
- Allows one movement to "peak" while another accumulates volume
- Psychological benefit (less boredom)

**Exercise Stability:** Main movements remain consistent within each block. Accessories can rotate more frequently based on need.

## Block 1: Accumulation Phase (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal:** Build work capacity, increase muscle mass, establish movement proficiency

**Volume:** High (18-24 sets Upper, 16-22 sets Lower)
**Intensity:** Moderate (RPE 7-8, mostly 8-12 rep range)
**Progression:** Add reps or sets week-to-week

**Rep Schemes:**
- Main lifts: 4×8-10 → progress to 4×10-12 over the block
- Secondary lifts: 3×10-12
- Accessories: 3×12-15

**Intensity Prescription:**
- Main lifts: RPE 7-8 (2-3 reps in reserve)
- Secondary lifts: RPE 7-8
- Accessories: RPE 7 (fatigue accumulation, not maximal)

**Week 4: Deload**
- Reduce volume by 40% (fewer sets)
- Maintain intensity (same weight, fewer sets)
- Same exercises (maintain skill)

**Expected Adaptations:**
- Increased muscle mass (hypertrophy)
- Improved work capacity (can handle more volume)
- Enhanced technique on all main lifts
- Slight body weight increase (+2-4lbs)

## Block 2: Intensification Phase (Weeks 5-8)

**Goal:** Build maximal strength, increase neural efficiency, move heavier loads

**Volume:** Moderate (14-18 sets Upper, 12-16 sets Lower)
**Intensity:** High (RPE 8-9, mostly 4-8 rep range)
**Progression:** Add weight week-to-week

**Rep Schemes:**
- Main lifts: 5×5 → 4×6 → 5×4 → 4×5 (wave loading across weeks)
- Secondary lifts: 4×6-8
- Accessories: 3×8-12

**Intensity Prescription:**
- Main lifts: RPE 8-9 (1-2 reps in reserve, heavy)
- Secondary lifts: RPE 8
- Accessories: RPE 7-8

**Week 8: Deload**
- Reduce volume by 50% (significantly fewer sets)
- Reduce intensity by 10% (lighter weight)
- Maintain exercise selection

**Expected Adaptations:**
- Significant strength gains on all main lifts
- Improved rate of force development
- Enhanced neural drive and motor unit recruitment
- Body weight stable or slight decrease (fat loss from intensity)

## Block 3: Realization Phase (Weeks 9-12)

**Goal:** Express peak strength, test new maxes, consolidate gains

**Volume:** Low-Moderate (12-16 sets Upper, 10-14 sets Lower)
**Intensity:** Very High (RPE 9-10, mostly 1-5 rep range)
**Progression:** Test strength, work up to heavy singles/triples

**Rep Schemes:**
- Main lifts: Work up to heavy 3RM or 5RM (Weeks 9-10), then heavy singles (Week 11)
- Secondary lifts: 3×5-8
- Accessories: 2-3×8-12 (reduced accessory work)

**Intensity Prescription:**
- Main lifts: RPE 9-10 (maximal or near-maximal)
- Secondary lifts: RPE 7-8
- Accessories: RPE 6-7 (maintain, don't accumulate fatigue)

**Week 12: Testing Week**
- Work up to new 3-5 rep maxes on main lifts
- Minimal accessories (only what supports main lifts)
- Celebrate strength gains, document progress

**Expected Adaptations:**
- Peak strength expression across all lifts
- New rep maxes established (programming next cycle)
- Confidence in handling heavy weights
- Total body weight likely decreased slightly (volume reduced, intensity high)

## Block 4: Overreach + Recovery (Weeks 13-16)

**Goal:** Push limits, then recover fully, prepare for next training phase

### Weeks 13-14: Functional Overreach
**Volume:** Very High (return to Block 1 volumes or slightly higher)
**Intensity:** Moderate-High (RPE 8-9)
**Purpose:** Deliberately accumulate fatigue to create supercompensation effect

**Rep Schemes:**
- Main lifts: 5×8-10 (high volume at submaximal weight)
- Secondary lifts: 4×10-12
- Accessories: 3-4×12-15

**Warning Signs:** This is intentionally hard. Expect to feel fatigued, sore, and slightly beat up by end of Week 14. That's the point.

### Weeks 15-16: Recovery Block
**Volume:** Low (10-12 sets Upper, 8-10 sets Lower)
**Intensity:** Low-Moderate (RPE 6-7)
**Purpose:** Full recovery, allow supercompensation, prepare for next cycle

**Rep Schemes:**
- Main lifts: 3×8 at easy weight
- Secondary lifts: 2×10
- Accessories: 2×12

**Outcome:** By end of Week 16, Marcus should feel fresh, recovered, and stronger than ever. Ready to start next training cycle with new rep maxes.

## Progressive Overload Strategies

**Accumulation Block:** Volume progression
- Week 1: 4×8
- Week 2: 4×10
- Week 3: 4×12
- Week 4: Deload (3×10 at reduced weight)

**Intensification Block:** Wave loading
- Week 5: 5×5 @ 80% estimated max
- Week 6: 4×6 @ 82%
- Week 7: 5×4 @ 85%
- Week 8: Deload (3×5 @ 75%)

**Realization Block:** Testing
- Weeks 9-10: Work up to heavy 3-5RM
- Week 11: Singles @ 90-95%
- Week 12: Test new maxes

**Beyond Linear:** Intermediates can't add 5-10lbs every session. Progression happens across blocks, not week-to-week.

## Intensity Guidelines

**RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion):**
- **RPE 6-7:** Could do 3-4 more reps, moderate effort
- **RPE 7-8:** Could do 2-3 more reps, hard effort
- **RPE 8-9:** Could do 1-2 more reps, very hard
- **RPE 9-10:** Could do 0-1 more reps, maximal effort

**RIR (Reps in Reserve):**
- Same concept as RPE, just framed differently
- RPE 8 = 2 RIR
- Easier to self-assess mid-set

**Auto-Regulation:** If a prescribed RPE 8 set feels like RPE 9, reduce weight slightly. If it feels like RPE 6-7, add weight. The goal is the stimulus, not arbitrary numbers.

## Training Recommendations

**Warm-Up Protocol:**
- 5 min light cardio
- Dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, thoracic rotation)
- Movement-specific warm-up (empty bar or light dumbbells)
- Ramp sets to working weight (2-3 sets building up)

**Rest Periods:**
- Main lifts: 2-4 minutes (longer in intensification and realization blocks)
- Secondary lifts: 90-120s
- Accessories: 60-90s
- Adjust based on recovery (if still breathing hard, wait longer)

**Tempo:**
- Accumulation: Controlled eccentrics (2-3s down)
- Intensification: Explosive concentrics, controlled eccentrics
- Realization: Maximal intent on every rep

**Form Non-Negotiables:**
- Full range of motion on all exercises
- Controlled eccentrics (no dropping weights)
- Proper breathing and bracing
- If form breaks down, end the set

**Recovery Between Sessions:**
- Minimum 1 rest day between upper/lower (built into schedule)
- Active recovery on off days (walking, light cardio, mobility)
- Sleep 7-9 hours per night (intermediates need more recovery than beginners)
- Manage life stress (training + work stress = cumulative fatigue)

## Metrics & Tracking

**Weekly Assessment:**
- Bodyweight (Monday AM, same conditions)
- Subjective readiness (1-10 scale: sleep, energy, soreness, motivation)
- Training log (weight, reps, RPE for all working sets)

**Block Assessment (every 4 weeks):**
- Body composition (scale + mirror, optional measurements)
- Strength testing (new 3-5RM on main lifts during realization)
- Fatigue status (how recovered do you feel?)
- Goal check-in (are we making progress toward objectives?)

**Progress Indicators:**
- Weight moved on main lifts (primary metric)
- RPE at same weight (if last block's RPE 8 is now RPE 7, you're stronger)
- Work capacity (can you handle more volume without excessive fatigue?)
- Body composition (muscle mass increasing, fat stable or decreasing)

**Red Flags:**
- Persistent joint pain (modify exercise or reduce load)
- Sleep disruption (may indicate overtraining)
- Loss of appetite (CNS fatigue)
- Motivation crash (psychological overtraining)
- Strength regression lasting >2 weeks (inadequate recovery)

## Nutritional Guidance (General)

**Protein:** 1.8-2.2g per kg bodyweight daily
- ~160-180g daily for Marcus (80kg bodyweight)
- Distributed across 4-5 meals

**Calories:**
- Accumulation blocks: Slight surplus (+200-300 cal/day) to support muscle growth
- Intensification/Realization: Maintenance or slight deficit (body recomp)
- Overreach: Slight surplus (need energy for high volumes)
- Recovery: Maintenance

**Peri-Workout:**
- Pre-workout: Carbs + protein 1-2 hours before (fuel session)
- Intra-workout: Optional for very long sessions (BCAAs or carbs)
- Post-workout: Protein + carbs within 2 hours (recovery)

**Hydration:** 3-4L water daily, more on training days

## Expected Outcomes

**By Week 4 (End of Accumulation):**
- Noticeable muscle growth (especially upper body)
- Improved work capacity (handling higher volumes comfortably)
- Movement proficiency on all lifts
- Body weight increased 2-4lbs

**By Week 8 (End of Intensification):**
- Significant strength gains (10-20% on main lifts from start)
- Body feels leaner and more muscular
- Confidence with heavier loads
- Technique refined under heavy loading

**By Week 12 (End of Realization):**
- New rep maxes established across all main lifts
- Peak strength expression
- Clear understanding of current capabilities
- Ready to test or compete

**By Week 16 (End of Recovery):**
- Fully recovered and feeling fresh
- Stronger than at Week 12 (supercompensation)
- Mentally refreshed and motivated for next cycle
- Ready to start new training phase with updated maxes

**Typical Strength Targets (Marcus, Starting → Week 12):**
- Bench Press: 225lbs × 5 → 250lbs × 5 (+25lbs)
- Back Squat: 275lbs × 5 → 315lbs × 5 (+40lbs)
- Deadlift: 315lbs × 5 → 365lbs × 5 (+50lbs)
- Overhead Press: 135lbs × 5 → 155lbs × 5 (+20lbs)

## Troubleshooting & Modifications

**If progress stalls:**
- Check recovery (sleep, stress, nutrition)
- Reduce volume by 10-20% for 1-2 weeks
- Swap out exercises causing issues
- Consider life factors (work stress, relationship issues)

**If joints hurt:**
- Modify exercise (change grip, stance, or implement)
- Reduce range of motion temporarily
- Add extra warm-up sets
- Incorporate prehab work (band work, light isolation)

**If motivation drops:**
- Take an unplanned deload week
- Swap in fun variations (specialty bars, different equipment)
- Train with a partner
- Revisit goals and why you're doing this

**If schedule disrupted:**
- Missing 1 session: Just skip it, continue next session
- Missing 2+ sessions: Repeat last week when you return
- Minimum 3 sessions/week to maintain progress (cut one day if needed)

**Exercise Substitutions (if equipment unavailable or injury):**
- Bench press → Dumbbell bench, floor press, machine press
- Back squat → Front squat, safety bar squat, leg press
- Deadlift → Trap bar deadlift, RDL, heavy KB swings
- Pull-ups → Lat pulldown, assisted pull-ups, inverted rows

## Next Steps After Program Completion

Upon completion of 16 weeks, Marcus will be assessed for:
1. Strength testing results and comparison to starting point
2. Body composition changes and goal re-evaluation
3. Program selection for next phase:
   - Continue upper/lower with updated maxes
   - Progress to push/pull/legs (5-6x/week)
   - Specialize in powerlifting or hypertrophy
   - Periodized plan for specific competition
4. Address any weak points identified during training
5. Incorporate advanced techniques as appropriate (clusters, pauses, tempo variations)

## Coach Notes

This program is designed for the intermediate lifter who has "graduated" from beginner linear progression. The key is patience—progress happens across blocks, not session-to-session.

Block periodization allows focused adaptation. Don't try to be maximally strong and maximally muscular simultaneously. Trust the process.

Exercise variation between Upper 1/2 and Lower 1/2 is critical. This isn't arbitrary—different angles and loading patterns prevent overuse while maintaining frequency.

Auto-regulation (RPE/RIR) is essential at this level. Not every session will feel perfect. Adjust as needed, but don't sandbag. The prescribed stimulus is there for a reason.

Week 4, 8, 12, and 15-16 are deload/recovery periods. These are NOT optional. Recovery is when adaptation happens. Skipping deloads leads to burnout, injury, or regression.

Celebrate wins: new rep maxes, improved work capacity, better technique. Progress isn't always linear, but over 16 weeks, Marcus will be significantly stronger and more muscular.
