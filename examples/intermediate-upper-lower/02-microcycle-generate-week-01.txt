# MICROCYCLE: WEEK 1 — Accumulation Phase

**Program:** Intermediate Upper/Lower Split Training Plan  
**Client:** Marcus Johnson  
**Microcycle:** Week 1 of 16 (Block 1: Accumulation — Week 1 of 4)  
**Focus:** Build work capacity, increase volume, establish movement proficiency  
**Volume:** High (18-24 sets Upper, 16-22 sets Lower)  
**Intensity:** Moderate (RPE 7-8, 8-12 rep range)

---

## Microcycle Overview

First week of the intermediate upper/lower split. Marcus is transitioning from a beginner full-body program and needs to adapt to higher training volumes and frequency. The accumulation phase emphasizes volume (sets × reps) over intensity to build work capacity and muscle mass.

This block uses higher rep ranges (8-12) with moderate loads. The goal is to accumulate training stress without excessive CNS fatigue. Each muscle group is trained twice per week (upper on Mon/Thu, lower on Tue/Fri) with different exercise selections to manage fatigue and prevent overuse.

**Training Schedule:**
- Monday: Upper 1 (Horizontal emphasis — bench press, rows)
- Tuesday: Lower 1 (Squat emphasis — back squat, quad work)
- Wednesday: OFF (active recovery)
- Thursday: Upper 2 (Vertical emphasis — overhead press, pull-ups)
- Friday: Lower 2 (Hinge emphasis — deadlift, posterior chain)
- Weekend: OFF (recovery)

**Recovery:** Minimum 1 rest day between upper/lower sessions. Wednesday provides mid-week recovery. Active recovery encouraged on off days.

## Week 1 Progression Summary

**Volume:**
- Upper 1: 20 working sets
- Lower 1: 19 working sets
- Upper 2: 20 working sets
- Lower 2: 19 working sets
- **Total:** 78 working sets for the week

**Intensity:**
- RPE 7-8 across all main lifts
- Moderate loads, emphasis on volume accumulation
- No sets to failure (leave 2-3 reps in reserve)

**Movement Patterns Trained:**
- Horizontal push: BB bench press, incline DB bench
- Horizontal pull: BB row, T-bar row
- Vertical push: OHP, incline BB bench
- Vertical pull: Pull-up, lat pulldown
- Squat: Back squat, front squat, leg press
- Hinge: Deadlift, RDL
- Lunge: Walking lunge
- Isolation: Lateral raises, curls, triceps, leg curl/extension, calves

**Exercise Variation:**
- Upper 1 vs Upper 2: Horizontal (bench/row) vs Vertical (OHP/pull-up)
- Lower 1 vs Lower 2: Squat emphasis vs Hinge emphasis
- Prevents overuse, provides novel stimuli

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Bodyweight (Monday AM): ___ lbs
- Sleep quality (1-10): ___
- Energy level (1-10): ___
- Muscle soreness (1-10): ___
- RPE accuracy (are prescribed RPEs matching actual effort?)

**Feedback Questions for Marcus:**
1. How did the 4-day split feel compared to 3-day full-body?
2. Recovery between sessions—adequate or need more rest?
3. Exercise selection—anything causing discomfort or pain?
4. Weight selection—were prescribed RPEs accurate?

## Week 2 Preview

Next week continues accumulation phase with rep increases:
- Main lifts: 4×8 → 4×10 (same weight)
- Secondary lifts: 3×10 → 3×12
- Accessories: same (3×12-15)

Goal is to add volume (more reps at same weight) without increasing intensity. This builds work capacity and drives hypertrophy.

**Planned Adjustments:**
- Reps increase by 2 per set on main lifts
- Weight stays the same (volume increase, not intensity)
- If 4×10 feels too easy (RPE <7), add 5-10lbs
