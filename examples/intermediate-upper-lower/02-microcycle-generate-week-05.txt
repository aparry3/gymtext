# MICROCYCLE: WEEK 5 — Intensification Phase

**Program:** Intermediate Upper/Lower Split Training Plan  
**Client:** Marcus Johnson  
**Microcycle:** Week 5 of 16 (Block 2: Intensification — Week 1 of 4)  
**Focus:** Build maximal strength, increase neural efficiency, move heavier loads  
**Volume:** Moderate (14-18 sets Upper, 12-16 sets Lower)  
**Intensity:** High (RPE 8-9, 4-8 rep range)

---

## Microcycle Overview

Marcus has completed the accumulation block (Weeks 1-4) and deloaded in Week 4. He's now entering the intensification phase where the focus shifts from volume to intensity. The goal is to increase maximal strength by lifting heavier loads with fewer reps.

Volume decreases (fewer total sets and reps) while intensity increases (heavier weight, RPE 8-9). This block uses lower rep ranges (4-8) to develop neural adaptations and maximal force production. Recovery between sets is longer (3-4 min) to ensure quality reps.

**Training Schedule:**
- Monday: Upper 1 (Horizontal emphasis — heavier bench, rows)
- Tuesday: Lower 1 (Squat emphasis — heavier squats)
- Wednesday: OFF
- Thursday: Upper 2 (Vertical emphasis — heavier OHP, pull-ups)
- Friday: Lower 2 (Hinge emphasis — heavier deadlifts)
- Weekend: OFF

**Key Changes from Accumulation:**
- Rep ranges drop (8-12 → 4-8)
- Weight increases significantly (10-15% heavier)
- Volume decreases (fewer total sets)
- Rest periods increase (3-4 min for main lifts)
- RPE increases (7-8 → 8-9)

## Week 5 Progression Summary

**Volume:**
- Upper 1: 17 working sets (down from 20)
- Lower 1: 15 working sets (down from 19)
- Upper 2: 17 working sets (down from 20)
- Lower 2: 15 working sets (down from 19)
- **Total:** 64 working sets (down from 78 in Week 1)

**Intensity:**
- RPE 8-9 on main lifts (up from 7-8)
- Weight increased 10-15% across all main lifts
- Lower rep ranges (5×5, 5×4 vs 4×8-12)

**Strength Progression (Week 1 → Week 5):**
- Bench Press: 185lbs × 4×8 → 210lbs × 5×5 (+25lbs, -3 reps)
- Back Squat: 225lbs × 4×8 → 255lbs × 5×5 (+30lbs)
- Deadlift: 265lbs × 4×6 → 295lbs × 5×4 (+30lbs, -2 reps)
- OHP: 115lbs × 4×8 → 130lbs × 5×5 (+15lbs)

**Key Adaptations:**
- Neural drive increased (moving heavier weights)
- Rate of force development improving
- Technique under heavy loads refining
- Psychological confidence with heavy weights building

**Recovery Considerations:**
- Longer rest periods between sets (3-4 min)
- Fewer total sets per session
- Still training 4x/week but lower overall volume
- CNS fatigue is higher than accumulation phase

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Bodyweight (should be stable or slight decrease)
- Sleep quality (critical for CNS recovery)
- Joint health (any pain or discomfort)
- Bar speed on main lifts (indicator of recovery)

**Feedback Questions for Marcus:**
1. How do the heavier loads feel? Strong or grinding?
2. Is 3-4 min rest adequate for main lifts?
3. Any joint issues with increased intensity?
4. Recovery between sessions—adequate or need more?

## Week 6 Preview

Next week continues intensification with wave loading:
- Main lifts: 4×6 (slightly higher reps, slightly lighter weight)
- Purpose: Provide variation, accumulate some volume at high intensity
- Still RPE 8-9, just different rep/set scheme

**Wave Loading Pattern (Weeks 5-7):**
- Week 5: 5×5 @ heaviest
- Week 6: 4×6 @ slightly lighter
- Week 7: 5×4 @ heaviest again (potentially heavier than Week 5)
- Week 8: Deload

This prevents staleness and allows progression within the block.
