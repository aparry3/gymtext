# MICROCYCLE: WEEK 9 — Realization Phase

**Program:** Intermediate Upper/Lower Split Training Plan  
**Client:** Marcus Johnson  
**Microcycle:** Week 9 of 16 (Block 3: Realization — Week 1 of 4)  
**Focus:** Express peak strength, test new maxes, consolidate gains  
**Volume:** Low-Moderate (12-16 sets Upper, 10-14 sets Lower)  
**Intensity:** Very High (RPE 9-10, 1-5 rep range)

---

## Microcycle Overview

Marcus has completed accumulation (Weeks 1-4) and intensification (Weeks 5-8) blocks. Week 8 was a deload. He's now entering the realization phase where the goal is to express the strength he's built and test new personal records.

Volume is lowest of all blocks (fewer total sets). Intensity is highest (RPE 9-10, working up to heavy 3-5RMs and singles). This block is about performance, not accumulation. Recovery between sets is maximal (4-5 min) to ensure quality attempts.

**Training Schedule:**
- Monday: Upper 1 (Work up to heavy 3-5RM bench)
- Tuesday: Lower 1 (Work up to heavy 3-5RM squat)
- Wednesday: OFF
- Thursday: Upper 2 (Work up to heavy 3-5RM OHP)
- Friday: Lower 2 (Work up to heavy 3-5RM deadlift)
- Weekend: OFF

**Key Changes from Intensification:**
- Rep ranges drop further (5×5 → heavy 3-5RM, singles)
- Working up to near-maximal loads (RPE 9-10)
- Volume significantly reduced (testing, not training)
- Rest periods maximized (4-5 min)
- Accessory work minimal (only what supports main lifts)

**Week 9-10 Strategy:**
- Work up to heavy 3-5RM on main lifts
- Test strength, establish new baselines
- Minimal accessories (don't accumulate fatigue)
