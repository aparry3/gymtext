# Intermediate — Hypertrophy Focus Examples

Reference examples for the Intermediate training plan (6-day PPL, 16 weeks).

## Plan Characteristics

- **Name:** Intermediate — Hypertrophy Focus
- **Split:** 6-Day Push/Pull/Legs (Volume Accumulation)
- **Frequency:** 6 days/week (2x per muscle group)
- **Duration:** 16 weeks
- **Primary Focus:** Hypertrophy (muscle growth) via progressive volume and mechanical tension
- **Progression:** Block periodization (accumulation → deload → intensification → final deload)
- **Target Audience:** 1-2 years training experience, ready for higher frequency

## Week Selection Rationale

**Week 1 (Accumulation Launch):**
- Establishes baseline volume (12-14 sets per muscle group)
- RPE 7-8 (moderate intensity, leave 2-3 RIR)
- Focus: Learning PPL structure, 6-day frequency adaptation
- Tracking emphasized from Day 1

**Week 7 (First Deload):**
- After 6 weeks accumulation (volume peaked at 18-20 sets)
- 50% volume reduction, 70-80% loads, RPE 6-7
- Active recovery (not coasting)
- Dissipates fatigue before intensification

**Week 13 (Peak Intensification):**
- RPE 8-9 (only 1-2 reps in reserve)
- Advanced techniques: rest-pause, drop sets, slow eccentrics
- Volume maintained (14-16 sets) but intensity peak
- Final push before Week 15-16 deload

## Block Periodization Structure

**Accumulation (Weeks 1-6):**
- Volume increases from 12-14 to 18-20 sets per muscle
- Intensity moderate (RPE 7-8)
- Focus: Build work capacity, hypertrophy

**Deload (Weeks 7-8):**
- 50% volume reduction
- 70-80% loads, RPE 6-7
- Active recovery, prepare for intensification

**Intensification (Weeks 9-14):**
- High loads (RPE 8-9)
- Volume 14-16 sets (slightly reduced from peak)
- Advanced techniques (rest-pause, drop sets, slow eccentrics)

**Final Deload & Assessment (Weeks 15-16):**
- 60% volume reduction
- Progress photos, measurements, plan next block

## Advanced Technique Deployment (Week 13)

**Rest-Pause (Primary Compounds):**
- Bench/Deadlift/Squat Set 4
- Failure → 15-30sec rest → 2-3 more reps
- Increases mechanical tension beyond standard failure

**Drop Sets (Isolation):**
- Lateral raises, curls, leg extensions final set
- Failure → reduce 30-40% → continue to failure
- Metabolic stress, muscle pump

**Slow Eccentrics (Accessories):**
- Incline press, pull-ups, Bulgarian split squats final set
- 4-5sec eccentric on every rep
- Increases time under tension, muscle damage

## Comparison: Week 1 vs Week 13

| Dimension | Week 1 (Accumulation) | Week 13 (Intensification) |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Volume | 12-14 sets/muscle | 14-16 sets/muscle |
| Intensity | RPE 7-8 (~70-75% 1RM) | RPE 8-9 (~80-85% 1RM) |
| Techniques | Standard sets | Rest-pause, drop sets, slow eccentrics |
| Session time | 65-75min | 70-80min (techniques add time) |
| Focus | Build volume tolerance | Maximize hypertrophy stimulus |

## PPL Split Structure

- **Mon:** Push (Chest & Shoulders emphasis)
- **Tue:** Pull (Back & Biceps)
- **Wed:** Legs (Quad emphasis)
- **Thu:** Push (Triceps & Front Delts)
- **Fri:** Pull (Rear Delts & Biceps)
- **Sat:** Legs (Hamstring & Glute emphasis)
- **Sun:** Rest or optional Zone 2 cardio

## Usage

These examples demonstrate:
- PPL split for intermediate trainees
- Block periodization (accumulation → deload → intensification)
- Advanced technique integration (final sets only, one per exercise)
- Appropriate volume/intensity for hypertrophy
- Strategic deloading (every 6-8 weeks)
- Progressive complexity from beginner examples
