      "overview": "Week 1 — Accumulation Phase Begins. This is your first week of the 16-week hypertrophy block. The goal is to establish baseline volume (12-14 sets per muscle group) and build work capacity. Intensity is moderate (RPE 7-8 on compounds, RPE 8 on accessories) to allow for progressive volume accumulation over the next 6 weeks. Focus on quality reps, controlled tempo, and mind-muscle connection. You'll train 6 days per week using a Push/Pull/Legs split, hitting each muscle group 2x per week. Rest periods: 2-3min for compounds, 60-90sec for accessories. Track all your lifts—you'll reference these numbers as volume increases.",

This week, volume drops by 50%—you'll cut sets in half while maintaining exercise selection and moderate intensity (70-80% of your working weights, RPE 6-7). The goal is NOT to push for PRs or test maxes. Focus on movement quality, technique refinement, and letting accumulated fatigue dissipate. You'll still train 6 days following the same PPL split, but sessions will be shorter (~40min vs 60min). This deload prepares you for the intensification phase (Weeks 9-14) where you'll push intensity higher. Sleep, nutrition, and stress management are priorities this week.",

Adjust for Week 8 if needed.",

Session: (1) Warm-up 5min, (2) Deadlift 2x6 @ 70-80% of Week 6 weight (very conservative—deadlift fatigue is systemic), (3) Lat Pulldown 2x10, (4) Seated Cable Row 2x12, (5) Reverse Fly 2x15, (6) Cooldown 5min. Notes: No preacher curls or cable curls (reduced bicep volume). Deadlift should feel light and crisp. If lower back is fatigued, skip deadlift entirely this week.",

Week 8 is also a deload (same structure as this week). After Week 8, you begin intensification (Weeks 9-14) where intensity ramps up to RPE 8-9 and you'll incorporate rest-pause sets, drop sets, and slow eccentrics. Use this week to recover fully.

These techniques push closer to muscular failure and maximize hypertrophy stimulus. Rest periods: 2-3min for compounds, 90sec for accessories, 60sec for isolation.
