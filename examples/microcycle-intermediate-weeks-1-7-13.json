      "overview": "Week 1 — Accumulation Phase Launch. Welcome to your first week of intermediate PPL training. You're transitioning from 3-4 days/week to 6 days/week, which means higher frequency per muscle group (2x/week) but distributed across more sessions. This week establishes your baseline volume: 12-14 sets per muscle group at moderate intensity (RPE 7-8, ~70-75% 1RM). The focus is on learning the PPL split structure and movement selection while leaving 2-3 reps in reserve (RIR) on all sets. You should finish each workout feeling challenged but not destroyed—accumulation is about building volume tolerance over 6 weeks, not maxing out in Week 1. Track all your lifts (weight, reps, RPE) in a training log. This data will guide your progression through Weeks 2-6. Expect mild fatigue as your body adapts to the increased frequency, but soreness should be manageable (you're not a beginner anymore). Rest 90-120sec between compound sets, 60-90sec between accessories/isolation.",

Volume: 10-12 sets for chest, 8-10 for shoulders, 8-10 for triceps. Session: (1) Warm-up 5-10min, (2) Incline Barbell Press 4x8-10 @ RPE 7-8 (upper chest emphasis, different angle than Monday's flat bench), (3) Flat Dumbbell Press 3x10-12 @ RPE 7-8 (chest thickness, squeeze at top), (4) Cable Flyes OR Pec Deck 3x12-15 @ RPE 8-9 (chest isolation, stretch at bottom, squeeze at contraction), (5) Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press 3x10-12 @ RPE 7-8 (front/side delt, similar to Monday but more reps for volume), (6) Front Raises 3x12-15 @ RPE 8 (front delt isolation, alternating or both arms), (7) Close-Grip Bench Press 3x10-12 @ RPE 7-8 (triceps mass builder, elbows tucked), (8) Triceps Pushdowns 3x15-20 @ RPE 8-9 (triceps isolation, keep elbows stationary, full extension), (9) Cooldown 5min.

Volume: 8-10 sets for hamstrings, 8-10 for glutes, 6-8 for quads, 4-6 for calves. Session: (1) Warm-up 5-10min: hip mobility, glute activation (banded walks, glute bridges), (2) Romanian Deadlift 4x10 @ RPE 7-8 (main hamstring/glute builder, feel the stretch, control the descent.

This completes your first 6-day PPL cycle! Sunday is full rest.",
        "Day 7 (Sunday) — Rest (or optional Zone 2 cardio). Complete rest is recommended after 6 consecutive training days. If you feel restless, you can do 20-30min easy cardio (bike, incline walk, rowing) at conversational pace—this aids recovery without adding stress. Otherwise, prioritize sleep, nutrition (hit protein targets: ~1g/lb bodyweight for hypertrophy), and mental recovery. Reflect on Week 1: How did the 6-day split feel? Any exercises that felt awkward? Any movements where you felt unusually strong or weak? Note these observations—they'll guide your training adjustments. Week 2 will follow the same structure but with slightly higher loads (add 5-10lbs to compounds if Week 1 felt easy). Accumulation phase continues through Week 6, gradually increasing volume (adding 1-2 sets every 2 weeks). Your body is adapting to higher frequency—trust the process."

      "overview": "Week 7 — Deload (Recovery Week). After 6 weeks of progressive volume accumulation, your body has accumulated fatigue—both muscular and neural. This week is a scheduled deload: you'll reduce volume by 50% (cut sets in half), reduce load to 70-80% of your working weights from Week 6, and keep intensity moderate (RPE 6-7, no grinding reps). The goal is NOT to coast or skip the gym—deloads are ACTIVE recovery. You'll maintain the same exercise selection and training frequency (still 6 days), but the reduced stress allows your body to dissipate fatigue, repair accumulated microtrauma, and super-compensate (adapt positively). Expect to feel fresh and energized by the end of Week 7. Sleep and nutrition remain critical—don't cut calories just because volume is lower. This deload prepares you for the intensification phase (Weeks 9-14), where loads will increase significantly. Many lifters see PRs immediately after a deload because they're fully recovered. Embrace the lighter week—it's part of the plan, not a break.",

Reps: Stay in the same rep ranges. RPE: 6-7 (leave 3-4 reps in reserve, no strain). Session: (1) Warm-up 5-10min (still important—prepare joints and CNS), (2) Barbell Bench Press 2x8 @ RPE 6-7 (if you used 185lbs in Week 6, use ~135-150lbs today—light and crisp), (3) Incline Dumbbell Press 2x10-12 @ RPE 6-7 (control the movement, no grinding), (4) Machine Chest Press OR Dips 2x12-15 @ RPE 6-7 (should feel easy—that's the point), (5) Dumbbell Shoulder Press 2x10 @ RPE 6-7, (6) Lateral Raises 2x15-20 @ RPE 7 (lighter weight, perfect form), (7) Overhead Triceps Extension 2x12-15 @ RPE 6-7, (8) Cooldown 5min. Total session time should be ~40-50min instead of 60-75min. You should leave the gym feeling refreshed, not depleted.",
        "Day 2 (Tuesday) — Pull: Back & Biceps (DELOAD). Same deload principles: half the sets, lighter loads, moderate intensity. Session: (1) Warm-up 5-10min, (2) Conventional Deadlift 2x6 @ RPE 6-7 (significantly lighter than Week 6—focus on speed and form, not load. This is technique practice), (3) Pull-ups OR Lat Pulldown 2x8-10 @ RPE 6-7 (should feel smooth and controlled), (4) Barbell Row OR Chest-Supported Row 2x10-12 @ RPE 6-7, (5) Single-Arm Dumbbell Row 2x12/arm @ RPE 7, (6) Face Pulls 2x15-20 @ RPE 7 (rear delt health—still important during deload), (7) Barbell Curls 2x10-12 @ RPE 6-7 (light weight, strict form), (8) Hammer Curls 2x12-15 @ RPE 7, (9) Cooldown 5min. Notice how much easier recovery is with reduced volume—you should feel minimal soreness tomorrow.",

Session: (1) Warm-up 5-10min, (2) Barbell Back Squat 2x8 @ RPE 6-7 (if you squatted 225lbs in Week 6, use ~165-185lbs today—focus on depth and tempo, not weight), (3) Leg Press 2x12-15 @ RPE 7 (moderate load, full ROM), (4) Bulgarian Split Squat 2x10/leg @ RPE 6-7 (unilateral work with lighter load), (5) Leg Extensions 2x15-20 @ RPE 7 (pump work, not grinding), (6) Romanian Deadlift 2x12 @ RPE 6-7, (7) Leg Curls 2x15 @ RPE 7, (8) Calf Raises 2x15-20 @ RPE 7, (9) Cooldown 5min.

        "Day 7 (Sunday) — Rest (or optional VERY light activity). Full rest is ideal. If you want movement, keep it to 15-20min easy walk or gentle yoga—no Zone 2 cardio this week (even that adds stress). Focus on sleep (aim for 8-9 hours), hydration, and nutrition. Reflect on the deload: Did you feel guilty for lifting lighter? That's normal but misguided—deloads are when adaptation happens. Your muscles, tendons, joints, and nervous system have been repairing all week. Week 8 continues the deload (same structure), then Week 9 begins intensification phase (higher loads, advanced techniques, same volume). You're setting yourself up for a massive performance jump in the coming weeks. Trust the process."

This week, intensity peaks: RPE 8-9 (~80-85% 1RM) on compounds, with only 1-2 reps left in reserve. Volume remains at 14-16 sets per muscle group (same as accumulation phase), but now you're incorporating advanced techniques to maximize hypertrophy stimulus: rest-pause sets (take a 15-20sec pause mid-set, then continue), drop sets (reduce weight 20-30% and continue to failure), and slow eccentrics (4-5sec negative on final sets). These techniques create mechanical tension, metabolic stress, and muscle damage—the three drivers of hypertrophy. Expect significant muscle soreness and fatigue accumulation. Sleep becomes non-negotiable (8-9 hours minimum), and nutrition must support recovery (slight calorie surplus, 1g+ protein per lb bodyweight). This is the hardest week of the program—your lifts should feel heavy, your muscles should burn, and you should be counting down to Week 15's final deload. But this is where growth happens.

Form is CRITICAL here—don't round your back chasing reps. Rest 3min between sets), (3) Weighted Pull-ups OR Lat Pulldown 4x6-8 @ RPE 8-9 (on final set, add 4-5sec eccentric on every rep—control the descent, feel the lat stretch.

        "Day 7 (Sunday) — Rest (NO cardio). Full rest. Your body has been under significant stress all week (advanced techniques create more damage than standard sets). Sleep 8-9 hours minimum. Eat at maintenance or slight surplus—don't diet during intensification. Hydrate well. If you're extremely sore, do 10-15min of VERY light walking or gentle stretching, but otherwise prioritize complete rest. Reflect on Week 13: How did the advanced techniques feel? Did you maintain form during rest-pause/drop sets? Any exercises where you felt particularly strong or weak? Week 14 is the final intensification week (same structure, potentially even heavier loads if you feel recovered). Then Weeks 15-16 are final deload and assessment. You're in the home stretch—one more week of peak intensity, then recovery and results. Your body is adapting to massive stimulus. Trust the process, eat, sleep, and prepare for Week 14."
