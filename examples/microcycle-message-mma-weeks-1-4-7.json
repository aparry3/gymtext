Focus on movement quality and technical proficiency—don't chase PRs. Leave room for high-quality MMA training. Build the foundation for power development in Weeks 4-5.\n\nThis Week:\n- Mon: Lower Power + Alactic (60min)\n- Tue: MMA Technical (light sparring)\n- Wed: Upper Strength + Core (60min)\n- Thu: MMA Sparring (moderate-high)\n- Fri: Explosive + Fight Sim (60min)\n- Sat: MMA Open Mat (highest volume)\n- Sun: Rest/Active Recovery\n\nS&C Intensity: RPE 7-8 (controlled)\nSparring: 60-85% effort\nRecovery: 8-9hr sleep, maintenance calories\n\nManage fatigue carefully. Pair lower power (Mon) with lighter MMA day (Tue). If bar speed drops, reduce load. Strength serves your fight game—not the other way around.",

Strength volume drops (3x3 @ 85-90%) but explosive work ramps up (5 sets Olympic lifts, 4 sets plyos). Goal: convert accumulated strength into explosive power. Bar speed and intent are primary metrics—if rep speed drops, reduce load. Conditioning peaks: 3 rounds fight simulation. Expect higher perceived exertion during MMA sessions.\n\nThis Week:\n- Mon: Lower Power + 8rd Alactic (60min)\n- Tue: MMA Technical (moderate, recover)\n- Wed: Upper Strength + Core (60min)\n- Thu: MMA Sparring (test power transfer)\n- Fri: Explosive + 3rd Fight Sim (60min)\n- Sat: MMA Hard Sparring (2-3 comp rounds)\n- Sun: Rest/Recovery (mental prep)\n\nS&C Intensity: RPE 8-9 (high)\nSparring: 75-90% effort\nRecovery: 8-9hr sleep, calorie surplus if weight allows\n\nThis is peak demand—manage carefully.
