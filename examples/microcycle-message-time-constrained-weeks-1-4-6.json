Each session: 30-35 minutes.\n\nThis Week:\n- Day 1: Full Body A (Push emphasis)\n- Day 2: Rest/active recovery\n- Day 3: Full Body B (Pull emphasis)\n- Day 4: Rest/active recovery\n- Day 5: Full Body C (Lower emphasis)\n- Days 6-7: Rest\n\nScheduling: Flexible. Mon/Wed/Fri recommended, or any 3 non-consecutive days.\n\nIntensity: RPE 6-7 (moderate, learn pacing)\nSession time: 30-35 min\nOptional finishers: 5-10min cardio (skip if no time)\n\nFocus this week: Master transitions between exercises. Don't rush—quality over speed. Track transition times and loads used. Consistency over perfection—3 focused sessions beats missing workouts.",
