4. Empty Bar Squat: × 5
5. Bar × 5, 135 × 3, 185 × 2, 225 × 1 (squat warm-up singles)

## Main Workout

### 1. Competition Squat
**Target:** 4 × 4 @ ~78-80% (RPE 7.5-8)
- **Set 1:** 245 lbs × 4 (warm-up set, RPE 6)

- **Set 6:** 295 lbs × 3 (RPE 8.5 — cut a rep, form broke on 3rd)
**Rest:** 4 minutes between working sets
**Notes:** Up 5 lb from last week's 290. First three working sets felt smooth, depth was good. Last set — hips shifted slightly on rep 3, shut it down at 3. Good call. Belt on for all working sets, sleeves on for 275+.

### 2. Close-Grip Bench Press
**Target:** 4 × 5 @ ~73% of bench (RPE 7-8)
- **Set 1:** 95 lbs × 8 (warm-up)

- **Set 4:** 145 lbs × 5 (RPE 7.5)
- **Set 5:** 145 lbs × 5 (RPE 7.5)
- **Set 6:** 145 lbs × 4 (RPE 8)
**Rest:** 3 minutes between working sets
**Notes:** Lockout felt better than two weeks ago. The board press work is transferring.

### 3. SSB Squat
**Target:** 3 × 6 @ RPE 7-8
- **Set 1:** 225 lbs × 6 (RPE 7)
- **Set 2:** 245 lbs × 6 (RPE 7.5)
- **Set 3:** 245 lbs × 6 (RPE 8)
**Rest:** 3 minutes between sets
**Notes:** SSB position feels more natural now. Good quad burn without any wrist strain.

### 4. Board Press (2-Board)
**Target:** 3 × 4 @ RPE 8
- **Set 1:** 185 lbs × 4 (RPE 7)
- **Set 2:** 195 lbs × 4 (RPE 7.5)

**Rest:** 3 minutes between sets
**Notes:** Went for 205 on the last set after the 200×3 PR last week. Got 3 clean reps — lockout speed was good on the first two, slower on 3. Progress.

## Notes
- Solid day overall. Squat moving well at 295. The cut set on set 4 was the right decision — no point grinding reps in accumulation.
- Board press at 205 is a new territory. Good sign for bench lockout.
- Total time: 98 minutes.

# Workout — Tuesday, February 17, 2026
**Focus:** Bench + Deadlift Accessories
**Location:** Powerlifting gym
**Duration:** ~95 minutes

## Warm-Up (10 minutes)
1. Band Pull-Aparts: 2 × 15
2. Shoulder Dislocates (band): × 10
3. Empty Bar Bench: × 8
4. 95 × 5, 115 × 3, 135 × 2 (bench warm-up)
5. Light deadlift: 135 × 5

## Main Workout

### 1. Competition Bench Press
**Target:** 4 × 4 @ ~78-80% (RPE 7.5-8)
- **Set 1:** 135 lbs × 4 (RPE 6)
- **Set 2:** 155 lbs × 4 (RPE 7)
- **Set 3:** 175 lbs × 4 (RPE 8)
- **Set 4:** 175 lbs × 4 (RPE 8)
- **Set 5:** 175 lbs × 3 (RPE 8.5)
**Rest:** 3-4 minutes between working sets
**Notes:** Up 5 lb from last week's 170. Competition pause on every rep. Rep 4 on set 3 was slow at lockout — classic weak point showing under fatigue. Set 5 cut to 3 reps when lockout stalled. Good awareness.

### 2. Deficit Deadlift (1" deficit)
**Target:** 3 × 4 @ ~73% of deadlift (RPE 7-8)
- **Set 1:** 185 lbs × 4 (warm-up)
- **Set 2:** 225 lbs × 4
- **Set 3:** 265 lbs × 4 (RPE 7)
- **Set 4:** 270 lbs × 4 (RPE 7.5)
- **Set 5:** 270 lbs × 4 (RPE 8)
**Rest:** 3 minutes between working sets
**Notes:** Standing on a 45 lb plate. Floor speed continues to improve — the pause work at 335 last cycle is paying off here too.

### 3. Pin Press (Pins at mid-chest height)
**Target:** 3 × 3 @ RPE 7-8
- **Set 1:** 155 lbs × 3 (RPE 7)
- **Set 2:** 160 lbs × 3 (RPE 7.5)
- **Set 3:** 165 lbs × 3 (RPE 8)
**Rest:** 3 minutes between sets
**Notes:** Dead-stop off pins. No stretch reflex — pure pressing strength through the sticking point. Lockout was clean on all reps.

### 4. Paused Deadlift (2-sec pause at knee)
**Target:** 3 × 2 @ ~75% (RPE 7-8)
- **Set 1:** 260 lbs × 2 (RPE 7)
- **Set 2:** 280 lbs × 2 (RPE 7.5)
- **Set 3:** 280 lbs × 2 (RPE 8)
**Rest:** 3 minutes between sets
**Notes:** 2-second pause just below the knee. Position held well — upper back didn't round. These are doing their job.

### 5. Dumbbell Lateral Raise
**Target:** 2 × 15
- **Set 1:** 12 lbs × 15
- **Set 2:** 12 lbs × 15
**Rest:** 60 seconds
**Notes:** Shoulder health. Light and easy.

## Cool Down (5 minutes)
1. Chest stretch (doorway): 30 sec each side
2. Lat stretch (hanging): 30 sec
3. Hamstring stretch: 30 sec each side

## Notes
- Bench at 175 is honest weight for 4s. Lockout weakness still visible on fatigued sets — but improving compared to 4 weeks ago when 170×4×4 was RPE 8.5.
- Deficit deadlifts feel increasingly productive. Floor speed is the best it's been in this prep.
- Total time: 93 minutes.

- **Set 4:** 235 lbs × 3 (RPE 7)
**Rest:** 3 minutes between working sets
**Notes:** Full 3-count in the hole. Maintained upright torso on all reps. Quads were screaming but position was solid.

**Target:** 3 × 6 @ ~68% (RPE 6-7)
- **Set 1:** 95 lbs × 6 (warm-up)

- **Set 3:** 125 lbs × 6 (RPE 6.5)

- **Set 2:** 310 lbs × 8
- **Set 3:** 310 lbs × 8

**Target:** 2 × 12
- **Set 1:** BW × 12
- **Set 2:** BW × 10
**Rest:** 60 seconds

## Notes
- Recovery day by design. Nothing should be hard and nothing was. Pause squats are a useful tool — builds confidence in the bottom position.
- Larsen press is growing on me. Good for feeling the bench without taxing the whole system.
- Total time: 72 minutes.

# Workout — Saturday, February 21, 2026
**Focus:** Competition Day Simulation
**Location:** Powerlifting gym
**Duration:** ~105 minutes

## Main Workout

### 1. Competition Squat — Heavy Doubles
**Target:** Work to 1 × 2 @ ~85% (RPE 8-8.5)
- **Set 1:** 275 lbs × 2 (RPE 7.5)
- **Set 2:** 290 lbs × 2 (RPE 8)
- **Set 3:** 300 lbs × 2 (RPE 8.5)
**Rest:** 4-5 minutes between sets
**Notes:** 300×2 is a solid number for week 7. Both reps had good depth. Bar speed was consistent — no grinders. Belt and sleeves on from 275.

### 2. Competition Bench — Heavy Doubles
**Target:** Work to 1 × 2 @ ~85% (RPE 8-8.5)
- **Set 1:** 145 lbs × 2 (RPE 6.5)
- **Set 2:** 160 lbs × 2 (RPE 7.5)
- **Set 3:** 170 lbs × 2 (RPE 8.5)
**Rest:** 4 minutes between sets
**Notes:** Full competition pause on both reps. Lockout on rep 2 was slower than rep 1 — the usual pattern. But it locked out. 170×2 paused is good for this point in prep.

### 3. Competition Deadlift — Heavy Doubles
**Target:** Work to 1 × 2 @ ~85% (RPE 8-8.5)
- **Set 1:** 275 lbs × 2 (RPE 7)
- **Set 2:** 305 lbs × 2 (RPE 7.5)
- **Set 3:** 320 lbs × 2 (RPE 8.5)
**Rest:** 5 minutes between sets
**Notes:** Both reps broke the floor faster than last Saturday's work. Deficit deadlifts and paused pulls are clearly transferring. Lockout was solid — no hitch. 320×2 is the heaviest double this prep.

### 4. Pendlay Row
**Target:** 3 × 5
- **Set 1:** 135 lbs × 5
- **Set 2:** 155 lbs × 5
- **Set 3:** 160 lbs × 5
**Rest:** 2 minutes between sets

### 5. Dips
**Target:** 2 × 6
- **Set 1:** BW × 6
- **Set 2:** BW × 6
**Rest:** 90 seconds

## Cool Down (5 minutes)
1. Hang from bar: 30 sec × 2 (spinal decompression after heavy squats/deads)
2. Hamstring stretch: 30 sec each side
3. Chest stretch: 30 sec each side
4. Hip flexor stretch: 30 sec each side

## Notes
- Best Saturday session of the prep so far. All three lifts hit heavier doubles than last week with comparable RPE.
- Squat: 300×2 puts estimated 1RM around 325-330. On track for 330 at the meet.
- Bench: 170×2 paused. Lockout is the limiter but it's getting better. Estimated 1RM ~190-195. Need a few more lbs to hit 200 on meet day — intensification phase will be key.
- Deadlift: 320×2 with good floor speed. Estimated 1RM ~365-375. On track for 375.
- Combined estimated total: ~885-900. Right in the window.
- Total time: 103 minutes.

## Weekly Summary
- **Squat:** 295×4×4 on Monday (up from 290), 300×2 on Saturday. Moving well. One cut set due to hip shift — good self-awareness.
- **Bench:** 175×4 on Tuesday (up from 170). Lockout weakness still showing under fatigue but improving. Board press at 205×3 is a new high.
- **Deadlift:** 270×4 deficit pulls, 280×2 paused, 320×2 competition. Floor speed is noticeably better than start of prep.
- **Bodyweight:** 155.4 lb — comfortable in class.
- **Weak points:** Bench lockout improving (board press transfer), deadlift off floor improving (deficit + pause transfer). Both trending in the right direction.
- **Next week (Week 8):** Last accumulation week. Push for final heavy session before transitioning to Intensification. May attempt 300×4 squat and 180×4 bench on main days. Saturday could see 310+ doubles.
