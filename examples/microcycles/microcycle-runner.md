# Microcycle — Week of February 16, 2026

**Program:** Marathon Supplemental Strength
**Phase:** Build
**User:** David

## Week Overview
Peak mileage week: 52 miles planned. IT band has been holding up with hip strengthening protocol. Lifting should support the running, not compete with it — holding weights steady this week and keeping RPE conservative. If anything feels heavy, back off. Friday is extra light to protect Saturday's 18-mile long run.

**Running schedule this week:**
- Mon: Easy 7 mi (8:15/mi) + lifting
- Tue: Tempo 8 mi (4 mi @ 7:10/mi)
- Wed: Easy 6 mi (8:20/mi) + lifting
- Thu: Track intervals (6 × 800m @ 6:30/mi pace)
- Fri: Easy 5 mi (8:30/mi) + lifting
- Sat: Long run 18 mi (8:30/mi)
- Sun: Full rest

- **Left side imbalance:** Still noticeable on Copenhagen plank and single-leg RDL. Continues to correlate with IT band side. Keep tracking.
