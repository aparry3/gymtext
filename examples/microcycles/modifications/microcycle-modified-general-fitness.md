## Weekly Summary
- **Upper Strength:** Bench progressed to 155×5 (top of RPE range). Pull-ups solid with +10 lb.
- **Lower Strength:** Goblet squat maxing out the 50 lb DB. RDL strong at 215×6. No knee issues. Moved from Wed to Thu to accommodate Tuesday run — worked out well.
- **Upper Hypertrophy:** Good variety with underhand rows and band work. Approaching DB ceiling on pressing.
- **Lower Hypertrophy:** Front squat with barbell confirmed as pain-free. Deadlift solid at 240×5.
- **Key decision:** Transition from goblet squat to barbell front squat as primary knee-dominant movement next cycle. Goblet can stay as warm-up.
- **Next week:** Deload — reduce weights 40%, 2 sets per exercise. Focus on recovery and movement quality.
- **Schedule adjustment note:** Tuesday's spontaneous run was well-tolerated. Shifting Lower Strength from Wed to Thu provided adequate recovery and didn't negatively impact performance.

## LOG

**Tuesday, February 17, 2026:**
- User reported going for a spontaneous 3-mile outdoor run instead of planned rest day
- Adjusted schedule: moved Wednesday's Lower Strength session to Thursday
- Made Wednesday a rest day to ensure proper recovery
- Rationale: Needed 48 hours between cardio and heavy lower body work to avoid compromising squat/deadlift performance

**Result:** Lower Strength session on Thursday performed well with no residual fatigue from Tuesday's run. Schedule adjustment was appropriate.
