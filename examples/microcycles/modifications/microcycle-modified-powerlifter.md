## Week Overview
Second hard week after the deload. Last week (Week 6) was the first post-deload session and everything felt smooth — squat 290×3×4 at RPE 7.5, bench 170×3×5 at RPE 8, board press PR at 200×3. This week: add 5 lb to competition lifts, push Saturday to heavier doubles. One more week after this before transitioning to Intensification.

**Modification (Feb 17):** User reported right elbow discomfort during Tuesday's bench session. Adjusted Week 7 plan:
- Reduced bench volume: 4×4 → 3×3 on Tuesday
- Removed close-grip bench from Monday
- Substituted neutral-grip DB press for close-grip work
- Kept board press (partial ROM is pain-free)
- Will monitor through Saturday's heavy doubles

**Bodyweight:** 155.4 lb / 70.5 kg (comfortable in class)

## Main Workout

### 1. Competition Squat
**Target:** 4 × 4 @ ~78-80% (RPE 7.5-8)

**Rest:** 4 minutes between working sets
**Notes:** Up 5 lb from last week's 290. First three working sets felt smooth, depth was good. Last set — hips shifted slightly on rep 3, shut it down at 3. Good call. Belt on for all working sets, sleeves on for 275+.

### 2. Close-Grip Bench Press
**Target:** 4 × 5 @ ~73% of bench (RPE 7-8)

- Board press at 205 is a new territory. Good sign for bench lockout.
- Total time: 98 minutes.

# Workout — Tuesday, February 17, 2026
**Focus:** Bench + Deadlift Accessories
**Location:** Powerlifting gym
**Duration:** ~90 minutes

**Modification:** User reported right elbow discomfort during warm-ups. Reduced volume from 4×4 to 3×3, monitored pain throughout session.

## Warm-Up (10 minutes)
1. Band Pull-Aparts: 2 × 15
2. Shoulder Dislocates (band): × 10
3. Empty Bar Bench: × 8
4. 95 × 5, 115 × 3, 135 × 2 (bench warm-up)
5. Light deadlift: 135 × 5

**Note:** Right elbow felt tender during 135×2 warm-up set. Decided to reduce working volume.

## Main Workout

### 1. Competition Bench Press
**Target:** ~~4 × 4~~ → **3 × 3** @ ~78-80% (RPE 7.5-8)
- **Set 1:** 135 lbs × 4 (RPE 6)
- **Set 2:** 155 lbs × 4 (RPE 7)
- **Set 3:** 175 lbs × 3 (RPE 8) — *reduced from 4 reps*
- **Set 4:** 175 lbs × 3 (RPE 8)
- **Set 5:** 175 lbs × 3 (RPE 8)
**Rest:** 3-4 minutes between working sets
**Notes:** Cut to 3×3 due to elbow discomfort. Competition pause on every rep. Elbow felt manageable with reduced volume — no sharp pain, just awareness. Bar path was clean on all reps.

### 2. Deficit Deadlift (1" deficit)
**Target:** 3 × 4 @ ~73% of deadlift (RPE 7-8)
- **Set 1:** 185 lbs × 4 (warm-up)
- **Set 2:** 225 lbs × 4
- **Set 3:** 265 lbs × 4 (RPE 7)
- **Set 4:** 270 lbs × 4 (RPE 7.5)
- **Set 5:** 270 lbs × 4 (RPE 8)
**Rest:** 3 minutes between working sets
**Notes:** Standing on a 45 lb plate. Floor speed continues to improve — the pause work at 335 last cycle is paying off here too.

### 3. Pin Press (Pins at mid-chest height)
**Target:** 3 × 3 @ RPE 7-8
- **Set 1:** 155 lbs × 3 (RPE 7)
- **Set 2:** 160 lbs × 3 (RPE 7.5)
- **Set 3:** 165 lbs × 3 (RPE 8)
**Rest:** 3 minutes between sets
**Notes:** Dead-stop off pins. No stretch reflex — pure pressing strength through the sticking point. Lockout was clean on all reps. Elbow felt okay with pin press — less strain than full ROM.

### 4. Paused Deadlift (2-sec pause at knee)
**Target:** 3 × 2 @ ~75% (RPE 7-8)
- **Set 1:** 260 lbs × 2 (RPE 7)
- **Set 2:** 280 lbs × 2 (RPE 7.5)
- **Set 3:** 280 lbs × 2 (RPE 8)
**Rest:** 3 minutes between sets
**Notes:** 2-second pause just below the knee. Position held well — upper back didn't round. These are doing their job.

### 5. Dumbbell Lateral Raise
**Target:** 2 × 15
- **Set 1:** 12 lbs × 15
- **Set 2:** 12 lbs × 15
**Rest:** 60 seconds
**Notes:** Shoulder health. Light and easy.

## Cool Down (5 minutes)
1. Chest stretch (doorway): 30 sec each side
2. Lat stretch (hanging): 30 sec
3. Hamstring stretch: 30 sec each side
4. Elbow flexor/extensor stretch: 1 minute each side — *added for elbow care*

## Notes
- Bench reduced to 3×3 at 175 due to elbow awareness. Made the right call — no aggravation.
- Deficit deadlifts feel increasingly productive. Floor speed is the best it's been in this prep.
- Elbow: tender but not worsening. Will ice tonight and monitor for Thursday/Saturday sessions.
- Total time: 88 minutes.

# Workout — Thursday, February 19, 2026
**Focus:** Squat Variation + Light Bench
**Location:** Powerlifting gym
**Duration:** ~75 minutes

**Modification:** Substituted neutral-grip dumbbell press for Larsen press to reduce elbow strain.

## Warm-Up (8 minutes)
1. Foam Roll: quads, glutes — 2 minutes
2. Banded Good Mornings: × 10
3. Empty Bar Squat: × 5
4. 95 × 3, 135 × 2 (pause squat warm-up)

## Main Workout

### 1. Pause Squat (3-sec pause in hole)
**Target:** 3 × 3 @ ~73% (RPE 7)
- **Set 1:** 185 lbs × 3 (warm-up)
- **Set 2:** 225 lbs × 3 (RPE 6.5)
- **Set 3:** 235 lbs × 3 (RPE 7)
- **Set 4:** 235 lbs × 3 (RPE 7)
**Rest:** 3 minutes between working sets
**Notes:** Full 3-count in the hole. Maintained upright torso on all reps. Quads were screaming but position was solid.

### 2. Neutral-Grip Dumbbell Press (feet-up)
**Target:** ~~Larsen Press~~ → **3 × 6** @ ~68% (RPE 6-7)
- **Set 1:** 50 lbs (each) × 6 (warm-up)
- **Set 2:** 60 lbs × 6 (RPE 6)
- **Set 3:** 65 lbs × 6 (RPE 6.5)
- **Set 4:** 65 lbs × 6 (RPE 7)
**Rest:** 2 minutes between working sets
**Notes:** Substituted neutral-grip DB press for Larsen press to give elbow a break. Neutral grip = less elbow stress. Feet off bench like Larsen for stability work. Elbow felt fine throughout — good call.

### 3. Leg Press
**Target:** 3 × 8
- **Set 1:** 270 lbs × 8
- **Set 2:** 310 lbs × 8
- **Set 3:** 310 lbs × 8
**Rest:** 2 minutes between sets
**Notes:** Moderate foot placement. Quad-focused — no need to go deep, just steady volume.

### 4. Cable Face Pulls
**Target:** 3 × 15
- **Set 1:** 30 lbs × 15
- **Set 2:** 30 lbs × 15
- **Set 3:** 30 lbs × 15
**Rest:** 60 seconds

### 5. Hanging Leg Raise
**Target:** 2 × 12
- **Set 1:** BW × 12
- **Set 2:** BW × 10
**Rest:** 60 seconds

## Notes
- Recovery day by design. Nothing should be hard and nothing was. Pause squats are a useful tool — builds confidence in the bottom position.
- Neutral-grip DB press substitution worked well — elbow felt better than it did on Tuesday.
- Total time: 72 minutes.

# Workout — Saturday, February 21, 2026
**Focus:** Competition Day Simulation
**Location:** Powerlifting gym
**Duration:** ~105 minutes

**Modification:** Reduced bench from planned 3×2 to 2×2, monitoring elbow. Will reassess for Week 8.

## Warm-Up (15 minutes)
Full meet-style warm-up:
1. Foam Roll + Band Work: 5 minutes
2. Squat warm-up: Bar × 5, 135 × 3, 185 × 2, 225 × 1, 255 × 1
3. Bench warm-up: Bar × 5, 95 × 3, 135 × 2
4. Deadlift warm-up: 135 × 3, 225 × 1

## Main Workout

### 1. Competition Squat — Heavy Doubles
**Target:** Work to 1 × 2 @ ~85% (RPE 8-8.5)
- **Set 1:** 275 lbs × 2 (RPE 7.5)
- **Set 2:** 290 lbs × 2 (RPE 8)
- **Set 3:** 300 lbs × 2 (RPE 8.5)
**Rest:** 4-5 minutes between sets
**Notes:** 300×2 is a solid number for week 7. Both reps had good depth. Bar speed was consistent — no grinders. Belt and sleeves on from 275.

### 2. Competition Bench — Heavy Doubles
**Target:** ~~Work to 1 × 2 @ ~85% (RPE 8-8.5)~~ → **Reduced volume: 2 × 2**
- **Set 1:** 145 lbs × 2 (RPE 6.5)
- **Set 2:** 160 lbs × 2 (RPE 7.5)
- **Set 3:** 170 lbs × 2 (RPE 8)
**Rest:** 4 minutes between sets
**Notes:** Stopped at 170×2 instead of progressing to 175-180. Elbow felt okay but not 100%. Full competition pause on both reps. Lockout on rep 2 was slower than rep 1 — the usual pattern. Conservative approach this week to protect elbow for final accumulation week and Intensification phase.

### 3. Competition Deadlift — Heavy Doubles
**Target:** Work to 1 × 2 @ ~85% (RPE 8-8.5)
- **Set 1:** 275 lbs × 2 (RPE 7)
- **Set 2:** 305 lbs × 2 (RPE 7.5)
- **Set 3:** 320 lbs × 2 (RPE 8.5)
**Rest:** 5 minutes between sets
**Notes:** Both reps broke the floor faster than last Saturday's work. Deficit deadlifts and paused pulls are clearly transferring. Lockout was solid — no hitch. 320×2 is the heaviest double this prep.

### 4. Pendlay Row
**Target:** 3 × 5
- **Set 1:** 135 lbs × 5
- **Set 2:** 155 lbs × 5
- **Set 3:** 160 lbs × 5
**Rest:** 2 minutes between sets

### 5. Dips
**Target:** 2 × 6
- **Set 1:** BW × 6
- **Set 2:** BW × 6
**Rest:** 90 seconds
**Notes:** Elbow felt fine with dips. Controlled descent, no pain.

## Cool Down (5 minutes)
1. Hang from bar: 30 sec × 2 (spinal decompression after heavy squats/deads)
2. Hamstring stretch: 30 sec each side
3. Chest stretch: 30 sec each side
4. Hip flexor stretch: 30 sec each side
5. Elbow flexor/extensor stretch: 1 minute each side

## Notes
- Squat: 300×2 on track. Estimated 1RM around 325-330.
- Bench: Held back at 170×2 due to elbow management. Ideally would have hit 175-180 this week, but protecting the elbow is the priority. Still paused cleanly.
- Deadlift: 320×2 with excellent floor speed. On track for 375 at meet.
- Elbow: Responding well to reduced volume. Will continue modified approach through Week 8 if needed.
- Total time: 102 minutes.

---

## Weekly Summary
- **Squat:** 295×4×4 on Monday (up from 290), 300×2 on Saturday. Moving well. One cut set due to hip shift — good self-awareness.
- **Bench:** Volume reduced due to elbow discomfort. Tuesday: 175×3×3 (instead of 4×4). Saturday: 170×2 (instead of progressing to 175-180). Lockout improving but elbow management took priority this week.
- **Deadlift:** 270×4 deficit pulls, 280×2 paused, 320×2 competition. Floor speed is noticeably better than start of prep.
- **Bodyweight:** 155.4 lb — comfortable in class.
- **Elbow status:** Right elbow tender from Tuesday onward. Reduced pressing volume, substituted neutral-grip DB work for Larsen press. No worsening with modified plan. Will continue monitoring.
- **Weak points:** Bench lockout improving (board press transfer), deadlift off floor improving (deficit + pause transfer). Both trending in the right direction.
- **Next week (Week 8):** Last accumulation week. If elbow feels better, attempt 300×4 squat and 180×3 bench on main days. If elbow still tender, keep bench volume conservative. Saturday could see 310+ squat doubles and 325+ deadlift doubles.

## LOG

**Tuesday, February 17, 2026:**
- User reported right elbow discomfort during warm-up sets
- Modified Tuesday's bench work: reduced 4×4 @ 175 lb to 3×3
- Removed close-grip bench from Monday's plan (retroactively — will apply to future weeks if elbow persists)
- Plan for rest of week: substitute neutral-grip DB pressing for barbell variations where possible
- Rationale: Elbow issue in Week 7 of 8 in Accumulation — better to manage now than risk aggravation before Intensification phase

**Thursday, February 19, 2026:**
- Substituted neutral-grip dumbbell press (feet-up) for Larsen press
- Neutral grip reduces elbow strain while maintaining pressing volume
- Elbow responded well — no discomfort during or after session

**Saturday, February 21, 2026:**
- Reduced bench doubles: stopped at 170×2 instead of progressing to 175-180
- Conservative approach to preserve elbow health for Week 8 and beyond
- Squat and deadlift unaffected — progressed as planned

**Assessment:** Elbow management strategy working. No worsening of symptoms. Will continue modified pressing approach in Week 8 if needed. Board press (partial ROM) remains pain-free and can continue as lockout work.
