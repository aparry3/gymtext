    "correspondingPlanExample": "intermediate-hypertrophy",
    "description": "Structured (parsed) version of the intermediate PPL hypertrophy plan. Demonstrates more complex periodization (block periodization with accumulation/intensification phases) and higher frequency (6 days/week) compared to beginner plan."

  "planStructured": {
    "name": "Intermediate Hypertrophy Focus",
    "type": "Push/Pull/Legs",
    "coreStrategy": "6-day Push/Pull/Legs split with volume accumulation for hypertrophy. High frequency per muscle group (2x/week) while managing fatigue through movement-pattern specificity. Uses block periodization: accumulation phase (increase volume) followed by intensification phase (increase load). Compound lifts (3-4 sets of 6-10 reps RPE 7-8), accessories (3-4 sets of 10-15 reps RPE 8-9), isolation (2-3 sets of 12-20 reps RPE 9).",
    "progressionStrategy": [
      "Phase 1 (Weeks 1-6): Accumulation — Gradually increase volume from 12-14 sets per muscle group to 18-20 sets. Add 1-2 sets every 2 weeks. Intensity moderate (RPE 7-8).",
      "Phase 2 (Weeks 7-8): Deload — Reduce volume by 50%, maintain exercise selection. Moderate intensity (don't push for PRs). Dissipate accumulated fatigue.",
      "Phase 3 (Weeks 9-14): Intensification — Increase load/intensity while maintaining volume (14-16 sets per muscle group). Add 5-10lbs to compounds when hitting top of rep range. Intensity high (RPE 8-9). Incorporate rest-pause, drop sets, slow eccentrics on accessories.",
      "Phase 4 (Weeks 15-16): Final Deload & Assessment — Reduce volume by 60%. Take progress photos, measurements, strength tests. Plan next training block.",
      "Exercise Variation: Rotate exercises every 4-6 weeks to prevent accommodation (e.g., flat bench → incline bench)."
    ],
    "adjustmentStrategy": "Scheduled deloads at Weeks 7-8 and 15-16. Cut volume by 50-60%, maintain exercise selection, keep intensity moderate (70-80% of working weights). Focus on technique refinement and recovery. Auto-regulation deload if needed mid-block: If 3+ consecutive sessions feeling flat, sleep disruption, or joint pain occurs, take 1 unscheduled deload week then resume.",
    "conditioning": [
      "Optional Zone 2 cardio: 2-3x/week, 20-30min (bike, incline walk, rowing)",

  "qualityNotes": "This intermediate example demonstrates more complex periodization compared to beginner plan: (1) Block periodization with distinct accumulation and intensification phases, (2) Higher training frequency (6 days vs 3 days), (3) More detailed progression strategy with specific set/rep/RPE targets for different phases, (4) Auto-regulation built in (scheduled deloads plus mid-block flexibility), (5) Exercise rotation strategy for preventing accommodation, (6) Volume targets per muscle group (14-20 sets), (7) Longer duration (16 weeks vs 12 weeks) to accommodate accumulation/intensification cycle."
