      "phase": "Progressive Overload (Weeks 3-6)",
      "rule": "Add weight when you complete all prescribed reps at RPE 7-8. For main compounds (squat, deadlift, bench, press): add 5-10lbs per week if RPE allows. For accessories: add 2.5-5lbs or add 1-2 reps per set. If you fail to complete reps for 2 consecutive sessions, reduce weight by 10% and rebuild."

  "deloadStrategy": "Week 8 is a scheduled deload. Reduce volume by 40% (fewer sets), use lighter loads (60-70% of Week 7 working weights), maintain movement patterns. Rest periods can extend to 90-120sec. No cardio finishers during deload. Focus on recovery: sleep 7-8 hours, eat at maintenance calories, light mobility work on rest days.",
  "safetyNotes": [
    "Supersets are demanding—ensure proper warm-up (5-10min light cardio + dynamic stretching before first superset)",
    "Rest periods are short (60-90sec)—if form breaks down significantly, extend rest to 2min or reduce weight",
    "Cardio finishers are optional—only add if you have energy and time. Skip if fatigued.",
    "If training 3x/week is too much, reduce to 2x/week (Day 1 and Day 3) until work capacity improves",
    "Listen to your body—if consistently exhausted or sleep-deprived, skip cardio finishers or take an extra rest day"
  ],
  "nutritionGuidance": "Time-constrained training is metabolically demanding. Eat at maintenance calories or slight surplus (200-300 cal above maintenance). Prioritize protein (0.8-1g per lb bodyweight). Pre-workout: light meal 1-2hr before (carbs + protein, e.g., banana + Greek yogurt). Post-workout: protein shake or meal within 1-2hr. Hydrate throughout the day—half your bodyweight in oz of water minimum.",
  "cardioFinishers": {
    "description": "Optional 5-10 minute high-intensity finishers to improve conditioning without adding significant time. Choose one per session if time/energy allows.",
    "options": [
      "Row intervals: 8 rounds of 20sec hard, 40sec easy",
      "Assault bike: 10 rounds of 15sec sprint, 45sec easy",
      "Jump rope: 5 rounds of 1min on, 30sec off",
      "Hill sprints: 6-8 sprints of 10-15sec, walk back down for recovery",
      "Farmer carries: 4 rounds of 40-50 yards with heavy dumbbells or kettlebells",
      "Burpees: 5 rounds of 10 burpees, rest 30sec between rounds"
    ]
  },
  "flexibilityNotes": "This program is designed for flexibility. If you miss a session, don't double up the next day—just continue the sequence (if you miss Day 2 Wednesday, do it Thursday and push Day 3 to Saturday). If you can only train 2x/week, alternate Day 1 and Day 3 each week. The key is consistency over perfection—3 focused 35min sessions beats one 90min session per week.",
  "expectedOutcomes": "After 8 weeks: strength increase of 10-20% on main lifts (squat, deadlift, bench, press), improved work capacity (ability to maintain intensity with short rest), better cardiovascular conditioning from finishers, visible muscle definition from density training. Most users report feeling more energized and less stressed despite busy schedules—short, intense workouts are mentally manageable and produce endorphin release without excessive fatigue.",
  "nextSteps": "After Week 8 deload, assess progress and goals. Option 1: Repeat this 8-week program with 10-20% heavier starting weights. Option 2: Transition to 4-day upper/lower split if you gain more time availability. Option 3: Add advanced techniques (rest-pause, drop sets) to current 3-day structure for continued progression. Option 4: Specialize toward a specific goal (strength, hypertrophy, or endurance) with more targeted programming."
