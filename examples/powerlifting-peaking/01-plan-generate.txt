## Program Overview

This is a 12-week peaking program designed to bring Sarah to peak strength on meet day. Unlike general strength programs that aim for continuous progress, peaking programs are **time-bound** and **goal-specific** — everything is structured backward from the competition date.

**Peaking vs. Off-Season Training:**
- Off-season focuses on building work capacity, muscle mass, and addressing weaknesses
- Peaking focuses on **expressing maximal strength** on a specific date
- Volume trends downward as intensity trends upward
- Accessory work decreases as specificity increases
- Taper is non-negotiable (cannot "make up" missed work in final weeks)

## Training Philosophy

**Meet Day is the Only Day That Matters:** Every training decision is made to optimize performance on April 15th. If training is going well, we resist the urge to test maxes early. If training is going poorly, we adjust to ensure readiness on meet day, not next week.

**Progressive Overload with a Deadline:** Unlike open-ended programs, we have exactly 12 weeks. Volume and intensity must be strategically timed to produce peak adaptations when they matter most.

**Specificity Increases with Proximity to Meet:** Early phases include variations and accessories. As the meet approaches, training becomes increasingly specific to competition lifts with competition technique.

**Taper is Training, Not Rest:** The final 2 weeks aren't "time off" — they're carefully structured to dissipate fatigue while maintaining strength. This is where the meet is won or lost.

## Program Structure

**Duration:** 12 weeks organized into 3 blocks + taper

**Meet Prep Timeline:**
- **Weeks 1-4:** Accumulation Block (Build capacity, address weaknesses)
- **Weeks 5-8:** Intensification Block (Increase load, reduce volume)
- **Weeks 9-10:** Realization Block (Peak intensity, test strength)
- **Weeks 11-12:** Taper Block (Reduce fatigue, maintain sharpness)
- **Week 12 (end):** MEET DAY

**Training Frequency:** 4 sessions per week
- **Monday:** Squat Day (primary squat session, bench accessory)
- **Tuesday:** Bench Day (primary bench session, speed deadlift)
- **Thursday:** Deadlift Day (primary deadlift session, squat variation)
- **Saturday:** Accessories Day (weakness work, hypertrophy, recovery)

**Rest Days:** Wednesday, Friday, Sunday (active recovery encouraged)

**Why This Split:**
- Each competition lift gets one heavy day per week
- Adequate recovery between max-effort sessions (48-72 hours)
- Saturday accessories day allows extra recovery before Monday squat
- Matches typical meet order (squat → bench → deadlift) in weekly microcycle

## Block Breakdown

### Block 1: Accumulation (Weeks 1-4)
**Purpose:** Build work capacity and address technical/muscular weaknesses

**Volume:** High (25-35 total lifts per session)
**Intensity:** Moderate (70-85% of 1RM)
**Rep Ranges:** 3-8 reps per set
**Specificity:** Medium (includes variations and accessories)

**Programming Strategy:**
- Competition lifts done with moderate intensity, higher volume
- Include variations to address weak points (pause squats, 2-count bench, deficits)
- Sufficient accessory work to maintain muscle mass
- RPE 7-8 on main lifts (challenging but sustainable)
- Weekly progression: add weight or reps, not both

**Example Week 1 Squat Day:**
- Comp Squat: 5×5 @ 75% (236lbs)
- Pause Squat: 3×3 @ 65% (205lbs)
- Romanian Deadlift: 4×8
- Leg Press: 3×12
- Abs and Core

**Sarah's Focus This Block:**
- Squat: Work on depth consistency and bracing
- Bench: Address weak lockout with board presses
- Deadlift: Improve setup and first pull (deficit work)

### Block 2: Intensification (Weeks 5-8)
**Purpose:** Increase loading while managing fatigue accumulation

**Volume:** Moderate (15-25 total lifts per session)
**Intensity:** High (80-90% of 1RM)
**Rep Ranges:** 1-5 reps per set
**Specificity:** High (primarily competition lifts)

**Programming Strategy:**
- Competition lifts with heavier loads, reduced volume
- Shift from variations to competition-specific technique
- Reduce accessory volume significantly
- RPE 8-9 on main lifts (very challenging, near-maximal)
- Weekly progression: increase intensity, maintain or slightly decrease volume

**Example Week 6 Squat Day:**
- Comp Squat: 5×3 @ 85% (268lbs)
- Pause Squat: 2×2 @ 75% (236lbs)
- Romanian Deadlift: 3×6
- Abs

**Sarah's Focus This Block:**
- Adapt to heavier loads psychologically
- Refine competition technique under fatigue
- Manage recovery aggressively (sleep, nutrition, stress)
- Begin visualizing meet performance

### Block 3: Realization (Weeks 9-10)
**Purpose:** Test peak strength and build confidence for meet day

**Volume:** Low (8-15 total lifts per session)
**Intensity:** Peak (90-97% of 1RM)
**Rep Ranges:** 1-3 reps per set
**Specificity:** Maximum (only competition lifts and minimal accessories)

**Programming Strategy:**
- Work up to heavy singles/doubles on competition lifts
- Test new PRs in training (openers and second attempts)
- Minimal accessory work (only what aids recovery)
- RPE 9-10 on top sets (true maximal efforts)
- Goal: Hit 90-95% of projected meet PRs in training

**Example Week 9 Squat Day:**
- Comp Squat: Work to 95% single (298lbs), then 90% × 1
- Pause Squat: 1×2 @ 70% (221lbs)
- Light abs

**Sarah's Target Lifts This Block:**
- Squat: 298-305lbs × 1 (training max, 95%+)
- Bench: 178-183lbs × 1
- Deadlift: 355-365lbs × 1

**Meet Attempt Selection:**
- **Opener (1st attempt):** ~90% of training max (should hit even on worst day)
- **Second attempt:** ~95-97% of training max (realistic PR)
- **Third attempt:** ~100-102% (stretch goal, all or nothing)

### Block 4: Taper (Weeks 11-12)
**Purpose:** Dissipate accumulated fatigue while maintaining strength and sharpness

**Volume:** Minimal (5-10 total lifts per session)
**Intensity:** Moderate to None (65-80% in Week 11, 50-60% in Week 12)
**Specificity:** Competition-only (no variations, no accessories)
**Frequency:** Reduced (3 sessions Week 11, 2 sessions Week 12)

**Taper Strategy:**
- **Week 11:** Last "training" week
  - Monday: Light squat singles @ 75-80%
  - Tuesday: Light bench singles @ 75-80%
  - Thursday: Light deadlift singles @ 75-80%
  - Saturday: OFF (no accessories, full rest)

- **Week 12:** Meet week
  - Monday: Openers only (squat/bench/deadlift @ opener weight, 1-2 singles each)
  - Tuesday-Thursday: OFF (mobility, light cardio, mental prep)
  - Friday: Travel, weigh-in, rest
  - **Saturday: MEET DAY**

**Critical Taper Rules:**
1. **Do not test maxes** in the final 2 weeks (last max singles in Week 10)
2. **Cut volume dramatically** (50% reduction Week 11, 75% reduction Week 12)
3. **Maintain some intensity** (don't go too light, stay sharp)
4. **Trust the process** (strength doesn't disappear in 10 days of rest)

**Week 12 (Meet Week) Schedule:**
- **Monday (9 days out):** Opener session
- **Tuesday-Thursday:** Rest, mobility, mental prep
- **Friday (1 day out):** Weigh-in (24hr or 2hr, federation-dependent), travel, light meals
- **Saturday:** MEET DAY
  - Morning: Warm up, equipment check
  - Flight time: Squat → Bench → Deadlift (usually 3-4 hours total)
  - Evening: Celebrate or analyze (depending on outcome)

## Percentage-Based Loading

Sarah's training is programmed using **percentage of 1RM** rather than RPE-only. This provides structure and prevents under/over-shooting on meet prep.

**Training Max vs. True Max:**
- Sarah's "training maxes" are ~95% of her absolute best lifts
- All percentages calculated from training max (not true max)
- This builds in a buffer for fatigue and bad days

**Calculating Training Loads:**

| Lift | True Max (Competition PR) | Training Max (95%) | 70% | 75% | 80% | 85% | 90% | 95% |
|------|---------------------------|-------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **Squat** | 315 | 300 | 210 | 225 | 240 | 255 | 270 | 285 |
| **Bench** | 185 | 176 | 123 | 132 | 141 | 150 | 158 | 167 |
| **Deadlift** | 365 | 347 | 243 | 260 | 278 | 295 | 312 | 330 |

**Auto-Regulation:**
- Percentages provide structure, but RPE provides flexibility
- If 85% feels like RPE 9, reduce to 82.5%
- If 85% feels like RPE 7, can push to 87.5%
- Trust feel on the day, especially in taper weeks

## Exercise Selection

### Competition Lifts (Weeks 1-12, all phases)
These are non-negotiable. Sarah competes in these, so they must be prioritized.

- **Back Squat** (high bar, competition depth, walkout from mono)
- **Bench Press** (competition grip, pause on chest, verbal commands)
- **Conventional Deadlift** (competition stance, mixed grip or straps)

### Primary Variations (Weeks 1-8, accumulation and intensification)
Used to address weak points and build specific strength qualities.

**Squat Variations:**
- **Pause Squats:** Improve bottom position strength and stability
- **Pin Squats:** Develop concentric strength from dead stop
- **Tempo Squats:** Build control and time under tension

**Bench Variations:**
- **Paused Bench:** Improve control and eliminate bounce
- **Close-Grip Bench:** Target triceps for lockout strength
- **Board Press:** Overload top range of motion

**Deadlift Variations:**
- **Deficit Deadlifts:** Strengthen start position and first pull
- **Paused Deadlifts:** Improve position and control off floor
- **Block Pulls:** Overload lockout strength

### Accessory Movements (Weeks 1-8, reduced Week 9-10, eliminated Week 11-12)

**Posterior Chain:**
- Romanian Deadlifts (hamstring/glute strength)
- Hip Thrusts (glute isolation)
- Back Extensions (spinal erectors)

**Quad Development:**
- Leg Press (quad volume without spinal load)
- Bulgarian Split Squats (unilateral strength)
- Leg Extensions (quad isolation)

**Upper Back:**

- Overhead Press (shoulder strength)
- Incline Press (upper chest)
- Dips (tricep strength)

**Arms and Grip:**
- Tricep Extensions (lockout support)
- Bicep Curls (elbow health)
- Farmer's Carries (grip endurance)

**Core:**
- Planks, Ab Wheel, Hanging Leg Raises (anti-extension)
- Pallof Press, Side Planks (anti-rotation)

## Progression Model

### Weeks 1-4 (Accumulation)
**Goal:** Progressive overload through volume

- **Week 1:** Establish baseline (5×5 @ 75%)
- **Week 2:** Add reps (5×6 @ 75%)
- **Week 3:** Add weight (5×5 @ 77.5%)
- **Week 4:** Deload (3×5 @ 70%, prepare for intensification)

### Weeks 5-8 (Intensification)
**Goal:** Progressive overload through intensity

- **Week 5:** Build to moderate-heavy (5×3 @ 82.5%)
- **Week 6:** Increase load (5×3 @ 85%)
- **Week 7:** Peak intensity (4×2 @ 87.5%)
- **Week 8:** Relative deload (4×3 @ 82.5%, prepare for realization)

### Weeks 9-10 (Realization)
**Goal:** Test strength and establish opener confidence

- **Week 9:** Heavy singles (work to 95% single, backoff set @ 90%)
- **Week 10:** Openers and second attempts (90-95% singles, no grinding)

### Weeks 11-12 (Taper)
**Goal:** Dissipate fatigue, maintain sharpness

- **Week 11:** Light technique work (75-80% singles, fast bar speed)
- **Week 12:** Openers only (Monday), then rest until meet

## Meet Day Strategy

### Weigh-In (Friday evening or Saturday morning)
- **24-hour weigh-in:** Easier to manipulate, can rehydrate/refuel overnight
- **2-hour weigh-in:** More stressful, requires precision (Sarah walks at 155, target 158)
- Bring snacks, electrolytes, and comfort food for post-weigh-in

### Warm-Up Protocol
- Arrive 90 minutes before flight
- Dynamic stretching, band work, movement prep (15 min)
- Bar work and progressive loading (30 min)
- Equipment check: belt tightness, shoe fit, singlet comfort
- Mental prep: visualization, music, focus cues

### Attempt Selection Strategy

**First Attempt (Opener):**
- **Goal:** Guaranteed lift on worst day
- **Weight:** ~90% of training max (e.g., Squat: 270lbs)
- **Rationale:** Get on the board, build confidence, avoid bombing out

**Second Attempt:**
- **Goal:** Realistic PR or match current best
- **Weight:** ~95-97% of training max (e.g., Squat: 285-290lbs)
- **Decision:** Based on opener bar speed and feel
  - Fast opener → aggressive second (97%)
  - Slow opener → conservative second (95%)

**Third Attempt:**
- **Goal:** Stretch goal, maximize total
- **Weight:** 100-103% of training max (e.g., Squat: 300-308lbs)
- **Decision:** Based on second attempt performance and total strategy
  - If ahead on total → go for PR
  - If behind on total → strategic jump to catch up
  - If PR secured → fun lift or safe total

**Total Management:**
- Calculate total after each lift round
- Adjust attempts based on performance and competition
- Focus on **making lifts**, not just hitting numbers
- Better to hit 3/3 with a 895 total than bomb out chasing 920

### Competition Day Logistics
- **Rack height:** Practice with adjustable rack, know your number
- **Warm-up room:** Identify location, equipment, timing
- **Flight order:** Track when you lift (usually 15-20 minutes between rounds)
- **Support crew:** Coach, handler, spotter (if available)
- **Hydration/fuel:** Sip water, small snacks between rounds (no heavy meals)

### Commands and Rules (USAPL/IPF)
**Squat:**
1. Walkout, referee calls "Squat"
2. Descend to depth (hip crease below top of knee)
3. Ascend, wait for "Rack" command
4. **Faults:** High, double bounce, losing balance, stepping forward/back

**Bench:**
1. Unrack, wait for "Start" command
2. Lower to chest, pause
3. Press up, wait for "Rack" command
4. **Faults:** No pause, butt off bench, heaving, uneven lockout

**Deadlift:**
1. Lift when ready (no start command)
2. Stand fully upright, shoulders back, knees locked
3. Wait for "Down" command, then lower
4. **Faults:** Hitching, ramping, downward motion, not locking out

## Recovery and Lifestyle

### Sleep
- **Target:** 8-9 hours per night, especially during intensification and taper
- **Naps:** 20-30 minute power naps beneficial if training twice per day
- **Sleep hygiene:** Dark room, cool temp, no screens 1 hour before bed

### Nutrition
- **Calories:** Maintenance or slight surplus (avoid dieting during meet prep)
- **Protein:** 1.6-2.2g per kg bodyweight (115-160g for Sarah)
- **Carbs:** High on training days (300-400g), moderate on rest days
- **Fats:** 60-80g per day for hormonal health
- **Hydration:** 3-4L water per day, more on training days
- **Pre-meet nutrition:** Practice meet-day meals during training (no surprises)

### Stress Management
- Meet prep is physically and mentally demanding
- Manage work stress, relationships, and life obligations
- Communicate with support system about training demands
- Use deload weeks to recharge mentally, not just physically

### Injury Prevention
- Warm up properly (10-15 minutes, every session)
- Mobility work on off days (hips, ankles, shoulders, thoracic spine)
- Address minor aches immediately (don't train through pain)
- Scale back if fatigue accumulates beyond normal (better to undertrain than overtrain)

- **Total Range:** 870-890lbs (respectable total, builds confidence for next meet)

**Regardless of Outcome:**
- Sarah gains meet experience and confidence
- She learns her response to peaking stimulus
- She identifies weaknesses for next training cycle
- She builds mental toughness and resilience

## Post-Meet Recovery

**Week 1 Post-Meet:**
- Complete rest or very light movement (walks, yoga, stretching)
- No lifting whatsoever
- Reflect on meet performance, analyze videos
- Celebrate or process disappointment

**Week 2 Post-Meet:**
- Return to light training (50% volume, 60-70% intensity)
- Focus on movement quality and enjoyment
- Reintroduce exercises that were removed during taper

**Weeks 3-4 Post-Meet:**
- Begin off-season training phase
- Address weaknesses identified during meet prep
- Build muscle mass and work capacity
- Enjoy training without meet pressure

**Next Meet Prep:**
- Minimum 12-16 weeks between meets for another peak
- Ideally 20-24 weeks for optimal improvement
- Use off-season to address weak points and build base

## Final Thoughts

Peaking for a powerlifting meet is equal parts science and art. The program provides structure, but Sarah's ability to listen to her body, manage stress, and execute technique under pressure determines success.

**Keys to Successful Meet Prep:**
1. **Trust the taper** — don't panic and add volume
2. **Make smart attempt selections** — ego has no place on the platform
3. **Focus on what you can control** — technique, effort, mindset
4. **Remember why you compete** — love of the sport, challenge, community
5. **Have fun** — meet day is the reward for 12 weeks of hard work

Sarah has put in the work. She's prepared physically and mentally. On April 15th, she'll step on the platform ready to perform. Whether she hits 900 or 895, she'll have proven that she can execute a plan, overcome obstacles, and test her limits.

**That's what powerlifting is all about.**
