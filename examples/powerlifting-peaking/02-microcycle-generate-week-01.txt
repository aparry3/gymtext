# MICROCYCLE: WEEK 1 - ACCUMULATION PHASE

**Athlete:** Sarah Chen  
**Meet Date:** April 15, 2026 (12 weeks out)  
**Block:** Accumulation (Week 1 of 4)  
**Phase Focus:** Build work capacity, establish baseline volumes, address technical weaknesses  
**Training Maxes:** Squat 300lbs | Bench 176lbs | Deadlift 347lbs

## Week 1 Overview

This is the first week of meet prep. Sarah is 12 weeks out from competition, fully recovered from her off-season training block. The focus is on building a base of work capacity and volume tolerance that will support the higher-intensity training to come.

**Volume:** High (25-35 total lifts per session)  
**Intensity:** Moderate (70-80% range)  
**RPE Target:** 7-8 (challenging but sustainable)  
**Specificity:** Medium (includes variations and accessories)

**Key Principles:**
- Establish movement quality before loading intensifies
- Build confidence with manageable weights
- Address weak points early (depth, lockout, start position)
- Create adaptation stimulus without excessive fatigue

## MONDAY - SQUAT DAY

**Primary Focus:** Competition squat volume, establish depth and bracing patterns

### Main Work
**Competition Back Squat:** 5 sets × 5 reps @ 75% (225lbs)
- **RPE Target:** 7-8 (2-3 reps in reserve on final set)
- **Rest:** 3-4 minutes between sets
- **Cues:** 
  - Big breath and brace before descent
  - Control the descent (3-second eccentric)
  - Hit depth confidently (hip crease below knee)
  - Drive through heels, maintain torso angle
  - Exhale at lockout, reset for next rep
- **Notes:** This should feel very manageable. Focus on quality reps, not grinding. Last set should still be crisp.

**Pause Squat:** 3 sets × 3 reps @ 65% (195lbs)
- **RPE Target:** 7 (should feel easier than comp squats)
- **Rest:** 3 minutes between sets
- **Cues:**
  - Descend to depth, pause for 2-count
  - Stay tight in the hole, don't relax
  - Explode out of the bottom position
- **Purpose:** Build bottom position strength and stability. Sarah sometimes loses tightness at depth.

### Accessory Work
**Romanian Deadlift:** 4 sets × 8 reps @ moderate load
- Focus on hamstring stretch and hip hinge pattern
- Load: ~135-155lbs (don't go too heavy, this is a builder)
- Keep back flat, push hips back, feel the stretch

**Leg Press:** 3 sets × 12 reps
- Quad volume without additional spinal loading
- Controlled tempo, full ROM
- RPE 7-8 (should burn but not to failure)

**Hanging Leg Raises:** 3 sets × 10 reps
- Core stability for squat bracing
- Controlled movement, no swinging

**Planks:** 3 sets × 45 seconds
- Anti-extension core strength
- Squeeze glutes, maintain neutral spine

**Session RPE:** 7/10 (solid work, manageable fatigue)  
**Session Duration:** ~90 minutes

### Main Work
**Competition Bench Press:** 5 sets × 5 reps @ 75% (132lbs)
- **RPE Target:** 7-8 (2-3 reps in reserve)
- **Rest:** 3-4 minutes between sets
- **Cues:**
  - Set up tight: leg drive, shoulder blades pinched, arch
  - Lower with control to chest (2-3 seconds)
  - Pause on chest for 1-count (practice comp pause)
  - Press explosively, lock elbows fully
  - Maintain position throughout set
- **Notes:** Sarah's lockout can be weak, so focus on full elbow extension and shoulder blade retraction at top.

**Close-Grip Bench Press:** 4 sets × 6 reps @ 65% of comp bench (115lbs)

## Weekly Summary

**Total Training Sessions:** 4  
**Total Lifts (Main + Variations):** ~120 reps across competition lifts and variations  
**Average Session RPE:** 6.5/10  
**Fatigue Level:** Moderate (should feel worked but not destroyed)  
**Compliance Expectations:** Sarah should complete all workouts feeling confident and strong

**Progression for Week 2:**
- Same lifts and percentages, but increase reps on competition lifts (5×6 instead of 5×5)
- This adds volume without increasing intensity
- Accessories stay the same or slightly increase load

**Weekly Checklist:**
- [ ] All main lifts completed at prescribed intensity
- [ ] No grinding reps on comp lifts (RPE stayed at 7-8)
- [ ] Quality of movement maintained across all sets
- [ ] Bodyweight stable (155-157lbs range)
- [ ] Sleep averaging 8+ hours per night
- [ ] Nutrition on point (adequate protein and carbs)

**Sarah's Subjective Feel (End of Week 1):**
"Feels like I'm just getting back into it. Weights are light enough that I'm focusing on technique and not worrying about grinding. Pause squats reminded me to stay tight at the bottom. Close-grip bench is definitely targeting my weak lockout. Deficit deadlifts are humbling but I can already feel the difference in my start position. Saturday accessories felt almost like a recovery day. Ready to add volume next week."

**Coach Notes:**
Week 1 is intentionally conservative. We're 12 weeks out, so there's no rush to test limits. The goal is to establish a baseline and ensure Sarah's technique is dialed in before intensity increases. If she finishes the week feeling like she could've done more, that's perfect — that's the point of accumulation. We're building the foundation for heavier work ahead.
