# MICROCYCLE: WEEK 5 - INTENSIFICATION PHASE

**Athlete:** Sarah Chen  
**Meet Date:** April 15, 2026 (8 weeks out)  
**Block:** Intensification (Week 1 of 4)  
**Phase Focus:** Increase intensity, reduce volume, build heavy load tolerance  
**Training Maxes:** Squat 300lbs | Bench 176lbs | Deadlift 347lbs

## Week 5 Overview

Sarah has completed the 4-week accumulation block. She's built work capacity, refined technique, and her body is adapted to training volume. Now we shift focus: **intensity goes up, volume comes down**. The goal is to get comfortable with heavier loads while managing fatigue carefully.

**Volume:** Moderate (15-25 total lifts per session)  
**Intensity:** High (80-87% range)  
**RPE Target:** 8-9 (1-2 reps in reserve, occasionally 0 RIR)  
**Specificity:** High (primarily competition lifts, fewer variations)

**Key Principles:**
- Get under heavy weight regularly to build confidence
- Reduce total reps but increase load per rep
- Cut accessory volume significantly (focus energy on main lifts)
- Manage recovery aggressively (sleep, nutrition, stress)

**What's Different from Week 1:**
- Percentages are 7-12% higher (75% → 82.5-85%)
- Reps per set are lower (5 reps → 3 reps)
- Total sets maintained or slightly increased (volume through sets, not reps)
- Accessories reduced by ~40%
- RPE increased from 7-8 to 8-9

## MONDAY - SQUAT DAY

**Primary Focus:** Heavy squat triples, build confidence under 85%+ loads

### Main Work
**Competition Back Squat:** 5 sets × 3 reps @ 82.5% (248lbs)
- **RPE Target:** 8-9 (1 rep in reserve on early sets, 0 RIR on final set)
- **Rest:** 4-5 minutes between sets (don't rush, full recovery)
- **Cues:**
  - Every rep is a single (reset breath and brace between reps)
  - Aggression on the descent, control the bar
  - Hit depth with confidence, no hesitation
  - Explode out of the hole, finish strong
  - If bar speed slows on set 4-5, that's expected at this intensity
- **Notes:** This is 50lbs heavier than Week 1. Sarah should feel the difference. Last set will be challenging but not grinding.

**Pause Squat:** 3 sets × 2 reps @ 75% (225lbs)
- **RPE Target:** 8 (similar weight to Week 1 comp squats, but paused)
- **Rest:** 4 minutes between sets
- **Cues:**
  - 3-second pause in the hole
  - Stay maximally tight during pause
  - Violent explosion out of bottom
- **Purpose:** Strength-speed out of the hole at heavier loads. This is now a true max-effort variation.

### Accessory Work (Reduced from Week 1)
**Romanian Deadlift:** 3 sets × 6 reps @ moderate-heavy
- Volume reduced from 4×8 to 3×6
- Load can increase slightly (~155-175lbs)
- Still a builder, not a grinder

**Leg Press:** 2 sets × 10 reps
- Reduced from 3×12
- Maintain tension, don't go to failure

**Hanging Leg Raises:** 2 sets × 10 reps
- Reduced volume, maintain core work

**Planks:** 2 sets × 45 seconds
- Core stability maintenance

**Session RPE:** 8.5/10 (significantly more taxing than Week 1)  
**Session Duration:** ~85 minutes (less accessory work = shorter session)

## TUESDAY - BENCH DAY

**Primary Focus:** Heavy bench triples, lockout strength under load

### Main Work
**Competition Bench Press:** 5 sets × 3 reps @ 82.5% (145lbs)
- **RPE Target:** 8-9 (1 rep in reserve early sets, 0 RIR final set)
- **Rest:** 4-5 minutes between sets
- **Cues:**
  - Set up maximally tight every single rep
  - Lower to chest with control (2-second eccentric)
  - Competition pause (1-2 second count)
  - Drive bar up explosively, finish lockout strong
  - Don't lose tightness between reps
- **Notes:** 145lbs for triples is significant work for Sarah. She should feel her lockout being challenged, especially on sets 4-5.

**Close-Grip Bench Press:** 4 sets × 4 reps @ 70% of comp bench (123lbs)
- **RPE Target:** 8
- **Rest:** 3 minutes between sets
- **Cues:**
  - Aggressive lockout drive
  - Feel triceps working hard
- **Purpose:** Lockout overload at heavy weights. This is now a primary lift, not just an accessory.

### Accessory Work (Significantly Reduced)
**Speed Deadlifts:** 5 sets × 2 reps @ 65% (225lbs)
- Increased from 60% to 65%
- Still explosive, but slightly heavier
- Rest: 90 seconds

**Barbell Rows:** 3 sets × 8 reps
- Reduced from 4 sets
- Load: ~155-175lbs

**Overhead Press:** 3 sets × 6 reps
- Reduced volume
- Load: ~85-95lbs

**Face Pulls:** 2 sets × 15 reps
- Maintenance only

**Tricep Pushdowns:** 2 sets × 10 reps
- Reduced volume
- Still important for lockout

**Session RPE:** 8/10 (bench day remains less taxing than squat/deadlift days)  
**Session Duration:** ~80 minutes

## THURSDAY - DEADLIFT DAY

**Primary Focus:** Heavy deadlift triples, position refinement under load

### Main Work
**Competition Deadlift:** 5 sets × 3 reps @ 82.5% (286lbs)
- **RPE Target:** 8-9 (1 rep in reserve early, 0 RIR on final set)
- **Rest:** 4-5 minutes between sets
- **Cues:**
  - Every rep: perfect setup (don't rush)
  - Pull slack out of the bar before initiating
  - Drive through floor with quads, not pull with back
  - Bar path tight to body
  - Lockout hips and knees simultaneously
  - Control descent, full reset between reps
- **Notes:** 286lbs for triples is near Sarah's old working sets from off-season. This should feel heavy but manageable. Last set will require focus and aggression.

**Deficit Deadlift (2-inch deficit):** 3 sets × 3 reps @ 70% (243lbs)
- **RPE Target:** 9 (deficits at this load are HARD)
- **Rest:** 4 minutes between sets
- **Cues:**
  - Maintain perfect position despite ROM challenge

**Dumbbell Rows:** 2 sets × 12 reps per arm
- Reduced from 3 sets

**Lateral Raises:** 2 sets × 15 reps
- Reduced from 3 sets

**(Skip bicep curls this week — not essential, save energy)**

### Lower Body (Minimal)
**Leg Extensions:** 2 sets × 15 reps
- Reduced from 3 sets

**Leg Curls:** 2 sets × 15 reps
- Reduced from 3 sets

## Weekly Summary

**Total Training Sessions:** 4  
**Total Lifts (Main + Variations):** ~90 reps (down from 120 in Week 1)  
**Average Session RPE:** 7.5/10 (up from 6.5/10 in Week 1)  
**Fatigue Level:** Moderate-High (this is expected with intensity increase)  
**Compliance Expectations:** Sarah should feel challenged but not broken

**Progression for Week 6:**
- Increase to 85% on competition lifts (5×3 @ 85%)
- Accessories stay similar or reduce slightly further
- RPE remains 8-9
- This continues the intensity push

**Weekly Checklist:**
- [ ] All main lifts completed at prescribed intensity (82.5%)
- [ ] Bar speed acceptable (slow but not grinding)
- [ ] RPE honest assessment (8-9 across main lifts)
- [ ] Recovery prioritized (sleep 8-9 hours minimum)
- [ ] Nutrition increased to match demands (extra carbs on training days)
- [ ] Bodyweight stable (155-157lbs)

**Sarah's Subjective Feel (End of Week 5):**
"Wow, that was a jump from accumulation. The weights felt heavy but in a good way — like I'm actually training for a meet now. Squat triples at 248 were challenging but my technique stayed solid. Bench lockout was tested on sets 4 and 5 but I got through it. Deadlifts at 286 felt heavy off the floor but I'm noticing my setup is getting more consistent. I'm definitely more tired at the end of the week than I was in Week 1-4. Saturday felt like a relief — glad we cut volume there because I needed the recovery. Excited to keep pushing intensity."

**Coach Notes:**
This is the critical transition week. Sarah is experiencing what real meet prep feels like: heavy loads, higher RPE, accumulated fatigue. If she reports excessive soreness or lingering fatigue into Week 6, we may adjust slightly (reduce one set, lower percentage by 2.5%). But if she adapts well, we continue the progression. The goal is to arrive at Week 9-10 ready to test maximal singles, not overtrained and broken.

**Monitoring for Overreach:**
- Sleep quality declining? (Adjust volume)
- Appetite suppressed? (Sign of high stress)
- Bar speed dramatically slower than Week 1? (Fatigue accumulating)
- Motivation dropping? (Mental fatigue, consider extra rest day)

If any red flags appear, we adjust. Meet prep is about arriving at the meet ready to perform, not proving toughness in the gym.
