# MICROCYCLE: WEEK 9 - REALIZATION PHASE

**Athlete:** Sarah Chen  
**Meet Date:** April 15, 2026 (4 weeks out)  
**Block:** Realization (Week 1 of 2)  
**Phase Focus:** Test peak strength, establish meet openers, build psychological confidence  
**Training Maxes:** Squat 300lbs | Bench 176lbs | Deadlift 347lbs

## Week 9 Overview

This is the moment we've been building toward. After 8 weeks of accumulation and intensification, Sarah is ready to test what she's capable of. This week, we work up to **heavy singles** on each competition lift — not quite maximal (we save that for the meet), but close enough to validate training and establish opener confidence.

**Volume:** Minimal (5-12 total lifts per session)  
**Intensity:** Peak (90-97% range)  
**RPE Target:** 9-10 (maximal or near-maximal effort)  
**Specificity:** Maximum (only competition lifts, no variations, minimal accessories)

**Key Principles:**
- Every single rep matters — no junk volume
- Work up to a top single at 95-97%, then 1-2 backoff singles
- Build psychological confidence: "I've lifted this in training, I can lift it on meet day"
- Assess technique under maximal load — any breakdowns to address in taper
- Establish openers (90% of top single) and projected second attempts (95%)

**What's Different from Week 5:**
- Singles instead of triples (testing max strength, not strength-endurance)
- Working up gradually (warm-ups matter more than ever)
- Fewer total sets (5-8 work sets per session max)
- Zero variations (100% competition lifts)
- Accessories virtually eliminated (core work only)

## MONDAY - SQUAT DAY (Peak Singles)

**Primary Focus:** Work to a 95-97% single, establish opener confidence

### Warm-Up Protocol (Critical)
Sarah needs to warm up properly for max singles. This isn't Week 1 anymore.

- **Bar × 10:** Movement prep, get blood flowing
- **95lbs × 5:** First load, movement check
- **135lbs × 5:** Second load, depth check
- **185lbs × 3:** Third load, brace and position
- **225lbs × 1:** 75%, should move fast
- **248lbs × 1:** 82.5%, last "easy" single
- **270lbs × 1:** 90%, projected opener weight
- **285lbs × 1:** 95%, goal single for today
- **(Optional) 295lbs × 1:** 98%, if 285 moved well and Sarah feels good

**Rest Between Warm-Up Singles:** 3-4 minutes (adequate recovery, don't rush)

### Main Work
**Competition Back Squat: Work to Top Single**
- **Target:** 95% single (285lbs minimum, 295lbs stretch)
- **RPE Target:** 9-10 (this should be a true near-max effort)
- **Cues:**
  - Perfect setup: feet, breath, brace, tightness
  - Controlled descent (don't bomb it, stay in control)
  - Hit depth with confidence
  - Maximal drive out of the hole, finish strong
  - If the bar moves, you made the lift — don't get stuck in the hole
- **Decision Protocol:**
  - If 285lbs moves with good speed (bar doesn't stall): attempt 295lbs
  - If 285lbs grinds but completes: stop there, 285 is the top single
  - If 285lbs fails: drop to 275lbs and hit that confidently

**Backoff Single:** 1 × 1 @ 90% (270lbs)
- After top single, rest 5-6 minutes
- Drop back to opener weight
- This should feel smooth and confidence-building
- Purpose: "I can hit my opener even when fatigued"

**Optional: Second Backoff:** 1 × 1 @ 85% (255lbs)
- Only if Sarah feels good and wants one more rep
- Should move fast and feel easy
- Ends session on a high note

### Accessory Work (Minimal)
**Plank:** 2 sets × 30 seconds
- Light core work only
- No heavy accessories today

**Session RPE:** 10/10 (this is max-effort day)  
**Session Duration:** ~70 minutes (including extended warm-up and rest)

**Post-Session Assessment:**
- **If Sarah hits 285-295lbs:** Opener confirmed at 270lbs, second attempt projected at 285-290lbs
- **If Sarah hits 275-280lbs:** Adjust opener to 260-265lbs, second attempt at 275-280lbs
- **Video Review:** Watch top single, assess depth, bar path, any technical breakdowns

## TUESDAY - BENCH DAY (Peak Singles)

**Primary Focus:** Work to a 95-97% single, test lockout under max load

### Warm-Up Protocol
- **Bar × 10:** Shoulder warm-up, movement prep
- **65lbs × 5:** First load
- **95lbs × 5:** Second load, groove pattern
- **115lbs × 3:** Third load, pause practice
- **135lbs × 1:** 77%, should move well
- **155lbs × 1:** 88%, getting heavy
- **167lbs × 1:** 95%, goal single for today
- **(Optional) 175lbs × 1:** 99%, if 167 moved well

**Rest Between Warm-Up Singles:** 3-4 minutes

### Main Work
**Competition Bench Press: Work to Top Single**
- **Target:** 95% single (167lbs minimum, 175lbs stretch)
- **RPE Target:** 9-10 (near-maximal effort)
- **Cues:**
  - Maximal tightness: legs, glutes, lats, shoulder blades
  - Lower with control (2-3 seconds)
  - Competition pause on chest (wait for imaginary "press" command)
  - Drive bar up explosively, focus on lockout
  - Sarah's lockout is her weakness — commit to finishing strong
- **Decision Protocol:**
  - If 167lbs moves smoothly with good lockout: attempt 175lbs
  - If 167lbs grinds at lockout but completes: stop there
  - If 167lbs fails at lockout: this is valuable info for meet prep, try 162lbs

**Backoff Single:** 1 × 1 @ 90% (158lbs)
- Opener weight
- Should feel very manageable
- Purpose: Confidence builder

**Optional: Second Backoff:** 1 × 1 @ 85% (150lbs)
- Fast and smooth
- Ends day on success

### Accessory Work (Minimal)
**Close-Grip Bench (Light):** 2 sets × 3 reps @ 60%
- Very light, technique work only
- Keep triceps engaged but not fatigued

**Face Pulls:** 2 sets × 12 reps
- Shoulder health maintenance

**Session RPE:** 9/10 (slightly less taxing than squat day)  
**Session Duration:** ~65 minutes

**Post-Session Assessment:**
- **If Sarah hits 167-175lbs:** Opener at 158-160lbs, second attempt at 167-170lbs
- **If lockout struggles:** Note this for taper work (light lockout drills in Week 11)

## Weekly Summary

**Total Training Sessions:** 3 (Mon/Tue/Thu only)  
**Total Lifts (Main):** ~20-25 singles across three days  
**Average Session RPE:** 9.5/10 (this is peak intensity week)  
**Fatigue Level:** High (expected after max singles, will dissipate in taper)  
**Compliance Expectations:** Sarah should feel accomplished but tired

**Meet Attempt Projections (Based on This Week):**

| Lift | Top Single (Week 9) | Opener (1st Attempt) | Second Attempt | Third Attempt |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Squat** | 285-295 | 270 | 285-290 | 300-305 |
| **Bench** | 167-175 | 158-160 | 167-170 | 178-185 |
| **Deadlift** | 325-340 | 310-315 | 325-335 | 350-360 |
| **Total** | — | 738-745 | 777-795 | 828-850 |

**Opener Strategy:**
- Openers should be **90% of top single** from this week
- Sarah should be able to hit these on her worst day
- Goal: Go 3/3 on first attempts, get on the board

**Second Attempt Strategy:**
- Based on opener performance
- If opener fast: go aggressive (95-97% of top single)
- If opener slow: go conservative (92-93% of top single)

**Third Attempt Strategy:**
- Depends on total goals and competition
- If 900lb total is within reach, go for it
- If far off, take a fun PR attempt with no pressure

**Weekly Checklist:**
- [ ] Hit target singles on all three lifts
- [ ] Video recorded for technique review
- [ ] Openers confirmed and communicated
- [ ] Any technical issues identified for taper correction
- [ ] Sleep prioritized (9+ hours per night this week)
- [ ] Nutrition on point (high carbs, high protein)
- [ ] Mental confidence assessed (does Sarah feel ready?)

**Sarah's Subjective Feel (End of Week 9):**
"That was intense. Squat single at 285 moved really well, I think I had 295 but decided to be smart and save it for the meet. Bench at 167 was a grind at lockout, but I finished it — that's exactly the weight I need to hit for a PR on meet day. Deadlift at 325 felt heavy off the floor but locked out clean. I'm honestly shocked at how much stronger I feel compared to 8 weeks ago. I know my openers, I know my second attempts, and I have targets for thirds. Now I just need to taper well and show up on meet day. Feeling confident."

## Week 10 Preview (Realization Week 2)

Next week is the final heavy week before taper. Sarah will:
- **Monday:** Squat opener + second attempt singles (270 + 285)
- **Tuesday:** Bench opener + second attempt singles (158 + 167)
- **Thursday:** Deadlift opener + second attempt singles (312 + 325)
- **Saturday:** Light movement or full rest

**Goal:** Groove meet attempts one more time, then begin taper.

---

**Coach Notes:**
Week 9 is where we learn if the training block worked. If Sarah hits her targets (285/167/325 or better), we proceed confidently into the taper. If she falls short, we adjust meet expectations and openers accordingly. The most important thing is that she leaves this week believing in her ability to perform on meet day. Numbers matter, but confidence matters more. If she needs to attempt slightly lower weights to finish on a high note, that's the right call. Meet day is 4 weeks away — plenty of time to peak if the taper is executed properly.
