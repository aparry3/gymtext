## MAIN WORK

### Exercise 1: Competition Back Squat
**5 sets × 5 reps @ 75% (225lbs)**

**Warm-Up Sets:**
- Bar × 10 reps (movement prep)
- 95lbs × 5 reps
- 135lbs × 5 reps
- 185lbs × 3 reps
- 205lbs × 1 rep (last warm-up before work sets)

**Working Sets:** 225lbs × 5 reps × 5 sets
- **Rest:** 3-4 minutes between sets
- **RPE Target:** 7-8 (should have 2-3 reps left in the tank on final set)
- **Tempo:** Controlled descent (3 seconds), explosive ascent

**Setup & Execution Cues:**
1. **Approach the bar:** Step under bar, position across upper traps/rear delts (high bar position)
2. **Hand placement:** Grip as narrow as mobility allows (creates upper back tightness)
3. **Unrack:** Big breath, brace core, stand up with bar
4. **Walkout:** 2-3 steps back, feet shoulder-width or slightly wider, toes pointed slightly out
5. **Before each rep:**
   - Take a BIG breath into belly (360-degree expansion)
   - Brace core as if someone's about to punch you in the stomach
   - Squeeze upper back, pull bar into traps
6. **Descent:**
   - Push knees out slightly as you descend
   - Keep chest up, eyes forward or slightly down
   - Maintain vertical torso angle (high bar squat)
   - Control the descent (don't bomb it, count 3 seconds down)
   - Hip crease must pass below top of knee (USAPL depth requirement)
7. **Bottom position:**
   - Stay tight, don't relax in the hole
   - Feel tension in glutes and hamstrings
   - Prepare to explode
8. **Ascent:**
   - Drive through full foot (not just heels)
   - Push floor away aggressively
   - Knees stay out, don't let them cave in
   - Maintain torso angle (don't let chest collapse forward)
   - Exhale at lockout, reset for next rep

**Coaching Notes:**
- This should feel MANAGEABLE. If you're grinding on set 3, the weight is too heavy.
- Focus on quality of movement, not how much you can lift
- Every rep should look the same (consistent depth, bar path, speed)
- If bar speed slows down significantly, stop the set (don't grind through bad reps)

**Between Sets:**
- Walk around, shake out legs
- Stay warm (keep hoodie on if needed)
- Sip water
- Mental reset: visualize the next set going smoothly

### Exercise 2: Pause Squat
**3 sets × 3 reps @ 65% (195lbs)**

**Setup:** Same as competition squat
**Working Sets:** 195lbs × 3 reps × 3 sets
- **Rest:** 3 minutes between sets
- **RPE Target:** 7 (should feel easier than competition squats)
- **Tempo:** Controlled descent, 2-second pause at bottom, explosive ascent

**Execution Cues:**
1. Same setup and descent as competition squat
2. **At bottom position:**
   - Come to a COMPLETE stop (2-second count: "one-thousand-one, one-thousand-two")
   - Stay maximally tight during pause (don't relax, don't settle deeper)
   - Feel tension building in muscles
3. **Out of the hole:**
   - Explode violently upward
   - This is a strength-speed movement (fast bar speed despite the pause)
   - Drive through full foot, knees out

**Purpose of This Exercise:**
- Sarah sometimes loses tightness at the bottom of her squat
- The pause forces her to stay braced and maintain position
- Builds strength out of the hole (the hardest part of the squat)
- Prepares for competition pauses (if she accidentally pauses at bottom, she'll be strong there)

**Coaching Notes:**
- The weight is lighter (195 vs 225), but the pause makes it challenging
- If Sarah can't maintain position during the pause (chest collapses, hips shoot up), reduce weight
- Focus on explosive drive out of the bottom

## ACCESSORY WORK

### Exercise 3: Romanian Deadlift (RDL)
**4 sets × 8 reps @ 135-155lbs**

**Setup:**
- Stand with barbell in hands (or deadlift it from floor)
- Feet hip-width apart
- Slight bend in knees (soft knees, not locked out)
- Shoulders back, chest up

**Execution:**
1. **Descent:**
   - Push hips BACK (this is a hip hinge, not a squat)
   - Keep back flat (neutral spine, no rounding)
   - Bar stays close to legs (drags down shins/thighs)
   - Lower until you feel a strong stretch in hamstrings (usually mid-shin level)
   - Knees stay slightly bent (don't straighten or bend more)
2. **Ascent:**
   - Drive hips forward to stand up
   - Squeeze glutes at top
   - Don't hyperextend back (just stand tall)

**Rest:** 2 minutes between sets  
**RPE Target:** 7 (should feel the hamstrings working, but not grinding)

**Purpose:**
- Build hamstring and glute strength (supports squat and deadlift)
- Reinforce proper hip hinge pattern
- Posterior chain hypertrophy
- This is a BUILDER exercise, not a max-effort lift

**Coaching Notes:**
- Load: Start with 135lbs, can increase to 155lbs if form stays perfect
- Focus on the STRETCH in the hamstrings, not how much weight you can move
- If back starts rounding, weight is too heavy or you're going too low

---

### Exercise 4: Leg Press
**3 sets × 12 reps**

**Setup:**
- Sit in leg press machine
- Feet shoulder-width apart, mid-platform
- Back flat against pad, grip handles

**Execution:**
1. Lower weight with control (3-second descent)
2. Bring knees toward chest (full range of motion)
3. Don't let lower back round off the pad (maintain neutral spine)
4. Press through full foot to extend legs
5. Don't lock knees out completely at top (keep slight bend)

**Rest:** 90 seconds between sets  
**RPE Target:** 7-8 (should burn, but not to complete failure)

**Purpose:**
- Additional quad volume without loading the spine
- After heavy squats, Sarah's back is fatigued — leg press allows more quad work safely
- Hypertrophy stimulus for leg development

**Coaching Notes:**
- Choose a weight where the last 2-3 reps are challenging but doable
- Controlled tempo matters more than weight
- If form breaks down (back rounds, heels lift), reduce load

---

### Exercise 5: Hanging Leg Raises
**3 sets × 10 reps**

**Setup:**
- Hang from pull-up bar
- Grip slightly wider than shoulder-width
- Let body hang straight (dead hang position)

**Execution:**
1. **Initiate with core:** Pull knees toward chest (or lift straight legs if able)
2. **Control the movement:** No swinging, no momentum
3. **Lower with control:** Return to starting position slowly
4. **Breathe:** Exhale as you lift, inhale as you lower

**Rest:** 60 seconds between sets

**Purpose:**
- Core strength for squat bracing
- Anterior core (abs) works to stabilize heavy loads
- Anti-extension strength (resisting lower back arching under load)

**Coaching Notes:**
- If 10 reps with knees is too easy, progress to straight leg raises
- If hanging is too hard, do these on captain's chair or lying on floor
- Quality over quantity: 8 perfect reps beats 12 sloppy reps

---

### Exercise 6: Planks
**3 sets × 45 seconds**

**Setup:**
- Forearms on ground, elbows directly under shoulders
- Body in straight line from head to heels
- Feet together or shoulder-width apart

**Execution:**
1. **Squeeze everything:** Glutes, quads, core
2. **Maintain neutral spine:** Don't let hips sag or pike up
3. **Breathe:** Don't hold your breath (breathe normally)
4. **Hold position:** 45 seconds per set

**Rest:** 60 seconds between sets

**Purpose:**
- Anti-extension core strength (prevents lower back hyperextension under load)
- Builds core endurance for long squat sets
- Teaches full-body tension (same tension needed when squatting)

**Coaching Notes:**
- If 45 seconds is too easy, add weight (plate on back)
- If too hard, drop to knees or reduce time to 30 seconds
- Focus on QUALITY: perfect plank for 30 seconds beats sloppy plank for 60 seconds

## COOL DOWN (5-10 minutes)

### Static Stretching
- **Quad stretch:** 30 seconds per leg
- **Hip flexor stretch:** 30 seconds per leg
- **Glute stretch (pigeon pose):** 30 seconds per side
- **Hamstring stretch:** 30 seconds per leg
- **Calf stretch:** 30 seconds per leg

### Optional Recovery
- **Foam rolling:** Quads, glutes, hamstrings, calves (2-3 minutes total)
- **Light cardio:** 5 minutes easy walk or bike (promotes blood flow and recovery)

**Purpose:**
- Begin recovery process
- Reduce muscle soreness
- Promote flexibility and mobility

## SARAH'S SUBJECTIVE FEEL (Expected)

"First day back to structured meet prep. Weights felt very manageable, which is exactly what we want in Week 1. The 225lbs squats were solid — I had plenty in the tank on every set. Pause squats at 195 reminded me to stay tight at the bottom, which is something I need to work on. RDLs gave me a good hamstring stretch. Leg press burned a bit at the end, but that's expected. Core work was straightforward. Left the gym feeling worked but not destroyed. Ready to come back tomorrow for bench day."

**Overall Session RPE:** 7/10 (solid training session, manageable fatigue)

---

**Coaching Notes for Next Week:**
- If this felt too easy (RPE 6 or below), we'll increase reps to 5×6 next week
- If this felt too hard (RPE 9), we'll adjust percentages down slightly
- For now, focus is on movement quality and building a foundation
