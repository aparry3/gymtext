# WORKOUT: WEEK 1 - SATURDAY (ACCESSORIES & RECOVERY DAY)

**Athlete:** Sarah Chen  
**Meet Prep:** Week 1 of 12 (Accumulation Phase)  
**Session Focus:** Weakness work, hypertrophy, active recovery  
**Estimated Duration:** 75 minutes  
**Target RPE:** 5 (this should feel almost restorative)

---

## PURPOSE OF THIS SESSION

After three heavy training days (Squat Monday, Bench Tuesday, Deadlift Thursday), Sarah's body needs recovery. However, complete rest isn't optimal — light work promotes blood flow, addresses weaknesses, and builds muscle without interfering with recovery.

**Key Principles:**
- Lower CNS demand (no competition lifts, no near-maximal efforts)
- Hypertrophy focus (muscle building, not strength testing)
- Address imbalances and weak points
- Leave feeling energized, not destroyed

**This is NOT a grind day.** If Sarah leaves exhausted, we've done too much.

## WARM-UP (10 minutes)

### General Warm-Up (5 minutes)
- Rowing or bike: 5 minutes easy pace
- Goal: Get blood flowing, prepare for light work

### Dynamic Movement Prep (5 minutes)
- **Arm circles:** 20 each direction
- **Band pull-aparts:** 2 × 15
- **Bodyweight squats:** 2 × 10
- **Leg swings:** 10 per leg, each direction
- **Push-ups:** 1 × 10 (movement prep)
- **Glute bridges:** 1 × 15

**Purpose:** Light activation, no heavy loading yet

---

## UPPER BODY WORK

### Exercise 1: Incline Dumbbell Press
**4 sets × 10 reps @ 40-50lbs per hand**

**Setup:**
- Incline bench set to 30-45 degrees
- Dumbbells in each hand
- Feet flat on floor

**Execution:**
1. Lower dumbbells to chest with control (3-second eccentric)
2. Press up to full extension
3. Don't let dumbbells drift too far forward
4. Focus on upper chest contraction

**Rest:** 90 seconds  
**RPE:** 7

**Purpose:**
- Upper chest development (accessory pressing volume)
- Dumbbell work allows more natural movement pattern
- Hypertrophy stimulus without heavy CNS demand
- Balanced chest development (competition bench emphasizes mid/lower chest)

**Coaching Notes:**
- Choose a weight where rep 10 is challenging but not to failure
- Controlled tempo is more important than weight
- This should feel like a good pump, not maximal effort

---

### Exercise 2: Pull-Ups (or Lat Pulldowns)
**4 sets × 8-10 reps**

**Setup (Pull-Ups):**
- Hang from pull-up bar
- Grip slightly wider than shoulder-width
- Full dead hang between reps

**Execution:**
1. Pull chest to bar (or as high as possible)
2. Lead with elbows, squeeze lats
3. Lower with control to full hang
4. No kipping or swinging

**Alternative (Lat Pulldowns):**
- If bodyweight pull-ups too hard, use lat pulldown machine
- Wide grip, pull bar to upper chest
- Lean back slightly, squeeze lats

**Rest:** 2 minutes  
**RPE:** 7

**Purpose:**
- Vertical pulling for back thickness
- Balances all the horizontal pulling (rows) from other days
- Lat development supports deadlift lockout
- Shoulder health (pulling balances pressing)

---

### Exercise 3: Dumbbell Rows
**3 sets × 12 reps per arm @ 50-60lbs**

**Setup:**
- One hand and knee on bench for support
- Dumbbell in opposite hand
- Back flat, parallel to floor

**Execution:**
1. Pull dumbbell to hip/lower ribcage
2. Lead with elbow (don't just curl the weight)
3. Squeeze lat and upper back at top
4. Lower with control
5. Full ROM (stretch at bottom, squeeze at top)

**Rest:** 60 seconds between arms  
**RPE:** 7

**Purpose:**
- Unilateral back work (address any side-to-side imbalances)
- Back thickness and strength
- More back volume supports bench press stability

---

### Exercise 4: Lateral Raises
**3 sets × 15 reps @ 15-20lbs**

**Setup:**
- Standing with dumbbells at sides
- Slight bend in elbows
- Core braced

**Execution:**
1. Raise dumbbells out to sides (like pouring water)
2. Lift to shoulder height (no higher)
3. Lead with elbows (not hands)
4. Lower with control (3-second eccentric)
5. Constant tension (don't rest at bottom)

**Rest:** 60 seconds  
**RPE:** 7

**Purpose:**
- Side delt hypertrophy (shoulder width and aesthetics)
- Shoulder health (strong delts support pressing movements)
- Balanced shoulder development

**Coaching Notes:**
- Light weight, high reps, controlled tempo
- This should BURN, but in a good way
- If form breaks down (swinging, leaning), weight is too heavy

---

### Exercise 5: Bicep Curls (choice: barbell, dumbbell, or cable)
**3 sets × 12 reps**

**Execution:**
1. Curl weight up with control
2. Squeeze biceps at top
3. Lower slowly (3-second eccentric)
4. Full ROM

**Rest:** 60 seconds  
**RPE:** 6

**Purpose:**
- Elbow health (bicep strength supports joint stability)
- Arm development
- Light work, not maximal

---

## LOWER BODY WORK (Light)

### Exercise 6: Leg Extensions
**3 sets × 15 reps**

**Setup:**
- Seated in leg extension machine
- Pad just above ankles
- Back against pad

**Execution:**
1. Extend legs to full lockout
2. Squeeze quads at top
3. Lower with control
4. Don't let weight stack touch between reps (constant tension)

**Rest:** 60 seconds  
**RPE:** 6

**Purpose:**
- Quad isolation without spinal loading
- Additional volume for quad development
- Light work, promotes blood flow to legs

---

### Exercise 7: Leg Curls
**3 sets × 15 reps**

**Setup:**
- Lying or seated hamstring curl machine
- Pad just above heels

**Execution:**
1. Curl heels toward glutes
2. Squeeze hamstrings hard at top
3. Lower with control (3-second eccentric)
4. Full ROM

**Rest:** 60 seconds  
**RPE:** 6

**Purpose:**
- Hamstring isolation
- Balance with leg extensions (quad/hamstring ratio)
- Supports deadlift strength
- Light volume for hypertrophy

---

### Exercise 8: Hip Thrusts
**3 sets × 12 reps @ 135-185lbs**

**Setup:**
- Upper back on bench
- Barbell across hips (use pad for comfort)
- Feet flat on floor, knees bent 90 degrees

**Execution:**
1. Drive hips up by squeezing glutes
2. Reach full hip extension (hips in line with shoulders and knees)
3. Squeeze glutes hard at top (2-second hold)
4. Lower with control
5. Don't hyperextend back (just squeeze glutes)

**Rest:** 90 seconds  
**RPE:** 7

**Purpose:**
- Glute isolation (important for squat and deadlift)
- Hip extension strength
- Posterior chain hypertrophy
- Low spinal loading (safe after heavy squat/deadlift week)

---

## CORE & CONDITIONING

### Exercise 9: Plank Variations
**3 sets × 45-60 seconds**

**Variations (choose one per set or mix):**
- Front plank
- Side plank (each side)

**Execution:**
- Maintain perfect position
- Squeeze everything (glutes, core, quads)
- Breathe normally

**Rest:** 60 seconds  
**RPE:** 5

**Purpose:**
- Core endurance
- Maintain core strength throughout meet prep

---

### Exercise 10: Farmer's Carries

## SARAH'S SUBJECTIVE FEEL (Expected)

"Saturday felt like a recovery day, which is exactly what I needed. After three heavy days, my body was ready for lighter work. Incline press and pull-ups gave me a good upper body pump without beating me up. Dumbbell rows felt solid, and lateral raises burned in a good way. Lower body isolation work (leg extensions, curls, hip thrusts) let me get some volume without taxing my CNS. Core work and farmer's carries were straightforward. I skipped the optional cardio because I felt like my body needed the rest. Left the gym feeling energized, not exhausted. Ready to start Week 2 on Monday."

**Overall Session RPE:** 5/10 (easiest day of the week, as designed)

## WEEK 1 REFLECTION

**What Went Well:**
- All main lifts completed at prescribed intensity (75%)
- Form stayed solid across all competition lifts
- RPE targets were hit (training was challenging but sustainable)
- Recovery was managed well (adequate sleep, nutrition, hydration)
- No injuries or significant pain

**Areas to Monitor:**
- Squat depth consistency (pause squats helped reinforce this)
- Bench lockout strength (targeted with close-grip work)
- Deadlift setup (Sarah tends to rush, needs deliberate positioning)

**Progression for Week 2:**
- Increase reps on competition lifts (5×6 instead of 5×5)
- Maintain same percentages (75%)
- Accessories stay the same or increase slightly
- This adds volume without increasing intensity

**Sarah's Readiness for Week 2:** ✅ READY

## COACHING NOTES

Week 1 was intentionally conservative. Sarah should finish this week feeling like she could've done more — that's the goal of accumulation. We're 11 weeks out from the meet. There's plenty of time to increase intensity. Right now, we're building work capacity and refining technique.

**Keys to Success:**
- Trust the process (don't rush to test maxes)
- Focus on movement quality
- Prioritize recovery
- Communicate any pain or concerns immediately

**Next Week Preview:**
Week 2 continues accumulation. Volume increases slightly (6 reps instead of 5), but intensity stays at 75%. This teaches Sarah's body to handle more work before we increase the load.
