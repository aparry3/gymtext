## MAIN WORK

### Exercise 1: Competition Deadlift
**5 sets × 5 reps @ 75% (260lbs)**

**Warm-Up Sets:**
- 135lbs × 5 reps
- 185lbs × 3 reps
- 225lbs × 2 reps
- 245lbs × 1 rep (last warm-up)

**Working Sets:** 260lbs × 5 reps × 5 sets
- **Rest:** 4 minutes between sets (deadlift requires more recovery)
- **RPE Target:** 7-8
- **Tempo:** Controlled setup, explosive pull, controlled descent

**Setup (CRITICAL - Sarah tends to rush this):**
1. **Bar Position:**
   - Bar over mid-foot (about 1 inch from shins)
   - If you look down, bar should cut your foot in half
2. **Foot Position:**
   - Stance: hip-width (conventional deadlift)
   - Toes pointed slightly out (5-15 degrees)
   - Weight balanced over full foot
3. **Grip:**
   - Mixed grip (one overhand, one underhand) OR double overhand with straps
   - Hands just outside legs
   - Grip the bar tightly (creates tension up the arms)
4. **Hip and Shoulder Position:**
   - Hinge at hips to reach bar
   - Shoulders OVER the bar or slightly in front (not behind)
   - Hips higher than knees, lower than shoulders
   - Shins ~vertical or slightly forward
5. **Back Position:**
   - Chest up, proud chest
   - Lats engaged (imagine squeezing oranges in armpits)
   - Neutral spine (natural curve, no excessive rounding or arching)
6. **Pull Slack Out:**
   - Before you pull, pull the bar tight against plates (you'll hear a click)
   - Build tension in hamstrings and back
   - Create tightness before bar leaves floor

**Execution:**
1. **Initiate the Pull:**
   - Big breath and brace
   - Drive through full foot (don't just pull with back)
   - Think "leg press the floor away"
   - Bar stays close to shins
2. **First Pull (floor to knees):**
   - Maintain back angle (don't let hips shoot up)
   - Bar drags up shins (may scrape, wear long socks)
   - Push knees back as bar passes them
3. **Second Pull (knees to lockout):**
   - Drive hips forward (hip extension)
   - Chest comes through
   - Lock hips and knees simultaneously
   - Stand tall, shoulders back
4. **Lockout:**
   - Fully upright (don't lean back excessively)
   - Chest up, shoulders pulled back
   - Glutes squeezed
   - Don't shrug or overextend
5. **Descent:**
   - Control the bar down (don't just drop it)
   - Push hips back first
   - Once bar passes knees, bend knees to lower to floor
   - FULLY reset before next rep (don't touch-and-go)

**Coaching Notes:**
- Sarah: Take your time on setup. You tend to rush and then your hips shoot up.
- Every single rep should start from a dead stop with perfect positioning
- 260lbs should feel solid but not grinding
- If form breaks down (back rounds, hips shoot up), stop the set

---

### Exercise 2: Deficit Deadlift (2-inch deficit)
**3 sets × 4 reps @ 65% (225lbs)**

**Setup:**
- Stand on 2-inch platform or stack of plates
- Same stance and setup as competition deadlift
- Bar is now 2 inches lower (increased ROM)

**Execution:**
- Same cues as competition deadlift
- Start position is more difficult (more knee bend, lower hips)
- Focus on driving through floor with quads
- Aggressive first pull off the deficit
- Don't let hips shoot up

**Rest:** 3 minutes  
**RPE Target:** 8 (deficits are HARD)

**Purpose:**
- Strengthen start position and first pull (Sarah's weak point)
- Improve leverage off the floor
- Builds explosive strength
- Addresses technical breakdown at start

**Coaching Notes:**
- This will feel harder than it looks (2 inches makes a big difference)
- If form breaks down significantly, remove the deficit
- Quality over quantity — 3 perfect reps beats 4 sloppy reps

## ACCESSORY WORK

### Exercise 3: Front Squat
**3 sets × 6 reps @ 135-155lbs**

**Setup:**
- Bar in front rack position (on front delts, elbows high)
- Clean grip (fingers under bar) or cross-arm grip
- Feet shoulder-width apart

**Execution:**
1. Keep elbows HIGH (parallel to floor)
2. Upright torso (more vertical than back squat)
3. Descend to depth
4. Drive up, maintaining torso position

**Rest:** 2.5 minutes  
**RPE:** 7

**Purpose:**
- Quad development without heavy back loading
- After deadlifts, Sarah's lower back is fatigued — front squats are easier on the spine
- Maintains squat volume throughout the week
- Upright position is good for thoracic mobility

**Coaching Notes:**
- Don't go too heavy (this is a builder, not a max-effort lift)
- If wrist mobility is limiting, use cross-arm grip or straps

---

### Exercise 4: Bulgarian Split Squats
**3 sets × 8 reps per leg @ 35-40lbs per hand**

**Setup:**
- Rear foot elevated on bench (12-18 inches high)
- Front foot 2-3 feet in front of bench
- Dumbbell in each hand

**Execution:**
1. Lower back knee toward floor
2. Front knee tracks over toes (don't let it cave in)
3. Descend until back knee almost touches floor
4. Drive through front foot to stand up
5. Balance challenge + strength work

**Rest:** 90 seconds between sets  
**RPE:** 7

**Purpose:**
- Unilateral leg strength (address any imbalances)
- Quad and glute development
- Balance and stability
- Minimal spinal loading

---

### Exercise 5: Hamstring Curls
**3 sets × 12 reps**

**Setup:**
- Lying or seated hamstring curl machine
- Adjust pad to sit just above heels

**Execution:**
1. Curl heels toward glutes
2. Squeeze hamstrings at top (full contraction)
3. Lower with control (3-second eccentric)
4. Full ROM

**Rest:** 60 seconds  
**RPE:** 7

**Purpose:**
- Hamstring isolation (supports deadlift)
- Knee health and stability
- Hypertrophy stimulus

---

### Exercise 6: Back Extensions
**3 sets × 15 reps @ 10-25lbs**

**Setup:**
- Back extension machine (GHD or 45-degree)
- Hips on pad, feet secured
- Hold light plate to chest (10-25lbs)

**Execution:**
1. Lower torso toward floor (controlled)
2. Hinge at hips (don't round back)
3. Extend back up to parallel or slightly above
4. Squeeze glutes at top
5. Don't hyperextend excessively

**Rest:** 60 seconds  
**RPE:** 6

**Purpose:**
- Spinal erector endurance
- Low back strength without heavy axial loading
- Posterior chain hypertrophy
- Injury prevention

---

## COOL DOWN (5-10 minutes)

### Static Stretching
- **Hip flexor stretch:** 30 seconds per side
- **Hamstring stretch:** 30 seconds per leg
- **Glute stretch:** 30 seconds per side
- **Lower back stretch (child's pose):** 60 seconds
- **Lat stretch:** 30 seconds per side

### Optional Recovery

- **Light cardio:** 5 minutes easy walk

## SARAH'S SUBJECTIVE FEEL (Expected)

"Deadlift day is always the hardest day of the week. 260 for sets of 5 felt solid, but I really had to focus on my setup. I noticed that when I rush my setup, my hips shoot up on the first pull — so I slowed down and made sure every rep started from a good position. Deficit deadlifts at 225 were humbling. That extra 2 inches makes a HUGE difference. My quads were burning off the floor, which tells me the deficits are doing their job. Front squats were a nice change from back squats earlier in the week. Bulgarian split squats challenged my balance but felt good. Hamstring curls and back extensions at the end weren't glamorous, but I know they're important. Left the gym feeling tired but accomplished. Tomorrow is rest day, then Saturday accessories."

**Overall Session RPE:** 7.5/10 (most taxing day so far this week)

## COACHING NOTES

Deadlift day is the most demanding session of the week. Sarah should prioritize recovery tonight:
- Sleep 8-9 hours minimum
- Extra carbs at dinner to replenish glycogen
- Light stretching or walking tomorrow (rest day)

If Sarah reports excessive lower back soreness or stiffness, we may reduce deficit deadlift volume next week. The goal is to build strength, not break her down.

**Technical Focus for Next Week:**
- Continue emphasizing setup deliberateness
- If hips are still shooting up, we may add pause deadlifts at lighter weight to groove proper positions
- Deficit work is valuable, but only if form stays solid
