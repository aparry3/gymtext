## MAIN WORK

### Exercise 1: Competition Bench Press
**5 sets × 5 reps @ 75% (132lbs)**

**Warm-Up Sets:**
- Bar × 10 reps
- 65lbs × 5 reps
- 95lbs × 5 reps
- 115lbs × 3 reps
- 125lbs × 1 rep (last warm-up)

**Working Sets:** 132lbs × 5 reps × 5 sets
- **Rest:** 3-4 minutes between sets
- **RPE Target:** 7-8
- **Tempo:** 2-3 second descent, 1-second pause, explosive press

**Setup Cues:**
1. **Foot position:**
   - Plant feet flat on floor (or on plates if legs are short)
   - Heels down, drive through full foot
   - Feet positioned to create leg drive
2. **Hip position:**
   - Glutes stay on bench entire time
   - Create slight arch in lower back (natural lordosis, not excessive)
   - Hips stay down (no bridging)
3. **Upper back:**
   - Shoulder blades pinched together tightly (retract and depress)
   - Upper back tight against bench
   - Create "shelf" for bar to land on
4. **Grip:**
   - Hands slightly wider than shoulder-width
   - Thumbs around bar (suicide grip is dangerous)
   - Wrists straight, not bent back
   - Squeeze bar tightly (creates full-body tension)

**Execution:**
1. **Unrack:**
   - With spotter's help, lift bar out and hold over chest
   - Lock elbows, settle into position
   - Take a big breath
2. **Descent:**
   - Lower bar with control (2-3 seconds)
   - Bar path: slight arc from over shoulders to lower chest
   - Elbows at 45-60 degree angle (not flared to 90 degrees)
   - Touch chest at nipple line or slightly below
   - Maintain upper back tightness
3. **Pause:**
   - Bar touches chest, hold for 1-count
   - Stay tight (don't relax on chest)
   - Practice competition pause ("press" command)
4. **Press:**
   - Drive bar up explosively
   - Leg drive into floor creates power
   - Press bar back toward face slightly (reverse arc)
   - Lock elbows fully at top
   - Sarah: focus on FINISHING the lockout (this is your weak point)

**Coaching Notes:**
- 132lbs should feel very manageable for sets of 5
- Last set might be challenging, but shouldn't be grinding
- Every rep should have a clean pause on chest
- If lockout struggles, that's normal — we're working on it with accessories

---

### Exercise 2: Close-Grip Bench Press
**4 sets × 6 reps @ 65% (115lbs)**

**Setup:**
- Same setup as competition bench
- **Grip width:** Hands ~12 inches apart (closer than comp grip, but not touching)
- Elbows stay closer to body (30-45 degree angle)

**Execution:**
- Lower to chest (same or slightly lower than comp bench)
- Pause briefly
- Press with emphasis on tricep engagement
- Focus on lockout strength

**Rest:** 3 minutes between sets  
**RPE Target:** 7

**Purpose:**
- Address Sarah's weak lockout
- Close-grip targets triceps more than wide grip
- Builds strength in top half of bench press ROM
- Accessory movement that directly transfers to competition lift

**Coaching Notes:**
- Don't go TOO close (causes wrist strain)
- Keep elbows tucked (if they flare, grip is too wide)
- This should feel like a tricep exercise

---

### Exercise 3: Speed Deadlifts
**6 sets × 2 reps @ 60% (208lbs)**

**Purpose:** Maintain deadlift technique and explosiveness without accumulating fatigue

**Setup:**
- Same stance and setup as competition deadlift
- Focus is on BAR SPEED, not load

**Execution:**
1. Set up perfectly each rep (don't rush)
2. Pull slack out of bar
3. Explode off the floor (as fast as possible)
4. Bar should move FAST through entire ROM
5. Control descent, fully reset before next rep

**Rest:** 90 seconds between sets  
**RPE Target:** 6-7 (should feel easy)

**Coaching Notes:**
- If bar speed slows down, weight is too heavy (reduce to 55%)
- This is NOT a grind — every rep should be explosive
- Purpose: technique practice and maintain deadlift motor pattern on bench day

---

### Exercise 4: Barbell Rows
**4 sets × 8 reps @ 135-155lbs**

**Setup:**
- Bend at hips (similar to RDL position)
- Slight bend in knees
- Back flat, core braced
- Grip barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width

**Execution:**
1. Pull bar to lower chest/upper abdomen
2. Lead with elbows (don't just pull with arms)
3. Squeeze shoulder blades together at top
4. Lower with control
5. Don't use momentum (no body English)

**Rest:** 2 minutes  
**RPE:** 7

**Purpose:**
- Upper back strength for bench press stability
- Balanced push/pull ratio (prevents shoulder issues)
- Lat and rhomboid development

---

### Exercise 5: Overhead Press
**3 sets × 8 reps @ 75-85lbs**

**Setup:**
- Bar in front rack position (resting on front delts)
- Feet hip-width apart
- Core braced

**Execution:**
1. Press bar straight overhead
2. Push head through once bar clears (finish with bar over mid-foot)
3. Lock elbows at top
4. Lower with control to front rack

**Rest:** 2 minutes  
**RPE:** 7

**Purpose:**
- Shoulder health and pressing strength
- Builds overhead stability
- Complementary pressing movement

---

### Exercise 6: Face Pulls
**3 sets × 15 reps**

**Setup:**
- Rope attachment on cable machine, set at face height
- Stand back with tension on cable

**Execution:**
1. Pull rope toward face
2. Split rope apart as you pull (ends go past ears)
3. Squeeze shoulder blades and rear delts
4. Return with control

**Rest:** 60 seconds  
**RPE:** 6

**Purpose:**
- Rear delt and upper back health
- Counteracts all the pressing
- Shoulder longevity

---

### Exercise 7: Tricep Pushdowns
**3 sets × 12 reps**

**Setup:**
- Cable machine, rope or bar attachment
- Stand upright, elbows at sides

**Execution:**
1. Push attachment down by extending elbows
2. Squeeze triceps at bottom
3. Control the eccentric (return)
4. Elbows stay in place (don't let them flare forward)

**Rest:** 60 seconds  
**RPE:** 7

**Purpose:**
- Tricep isolation for lockout strength
- Direct work on Sarah's weak point
- Hypertrophy stimulus for arms

---

## SARAH'S SUBJECTIVE FEEL (Expected)

"Bench day felt solid. 132lbs for sets of 5 was manageable, and I focused on that pause on my chest every single rep. My lockout was definitely the hardest part — bar slowed down near the top on sets 4 and 5, but I finished them. Close-grip bench at 115 targeted my triceps like it should. Speed deadlifts felt easy and fast, which is the point. Upper back work (rows, face pulls) felt good. Tricep pushdowns at the end gave me a nice pump. Left feeling worked but not destroyed. Ready for deadlifts on Thursday."

**Overall Session RPE:** 6.5/10

---

**Coaching Notes:**
Bench day is inherently less fatiguing than squat or deadlift days. Sarah should leave feeling fresh enough to train hard on Thursday. If lockout continues to be a struggle throughout the program, we may add board presses or more lockout-specific work in future weeks.
