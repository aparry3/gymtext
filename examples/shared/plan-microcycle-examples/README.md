## 1. Beginner — General Fitness Foundation

**Split:** 3-Day Full Body (NASM Stabilization Endurance Phase)  
**Focus:** Movement quality, stabilization, and building a sustainable training habit.

### Program Architecture
Full-body training 3x/week maximizes movement frequency for skill acquisition while providing ample recovery for a beginner.

### Weekly Schedule
- **Mon:** Full Body — Lower emphasis (Squat, Hinge, Push patterns)
- **Wed:** Full Body — Upper emphasis (Push, Pull, Core)
- **Fri:** Full Body — Balanced (All movement patterns)
- **Tue/Thu/Sun:** Rest
- **Sat:** Optional Active Recovery

### Session Guidelines
- 2-3 sets of 12-15 reps, slow tempo (3-1-1)
- 60-90sec rest, light load (50-60% 1RM)
- Each session: warm-up → squat → hinge → push → pull → vertical push/pull → core → cool-down
- Optional Zone 2 cardio post-workout (10-15min)

### Progression
- Weeks 1-4: Form mastery with light loads
- Weeks 5-8: Add 5-10lbs when hitting 3x15 with clean form
- Weeks 9-12: Add complexity (single-leg variations, barbell lifts)
- Deload every 4th week (reduce volume 40-50%)

### Key Principles
Form first. Consistency over intensity. Sleep 7-9 hours. Start with dumbbells/machines, progress to barbells by Week 9.

## 2. Intermediate — Hypertrophy Focus

**Split:** 6-Day Push/Pull/Legs with Volume Accumulation  
**Focus:** Hypertrophy (muscle growth) via progressive volume and mechanical tension.

### Weekly Schedule
- **Mon:** Push — Chest & Shoulders
- **Tue:** Pull — Back & Biceps
- **Wed:** Legs — Quad emphasis
- **Thu:** Push — Triceps & Front Delts
- **Fri:** Pull — Rear Delts & Biceps
- **Sat:** Legs — Hamstring & Glute emphasis
- **Sun:** Rest or Zone 2 cardio

### Session Guidelines
- Compounds: 3-4 sets of 6-10 reps (RPE 7-8)
- Accessories: 3-4 sets of 10-15 reps (RPE 8-9)
- Isolation: 2-3 sets of 12-20 reps (RPE 9)
- Weekly volume: 14-20 sets per muscle group

### Progression (16-Week Block Periodization)
- **Weeks 1-6 (Accumulation):** Gradually increase volume from 12-14 to 18-20 sets/muscle
- **Weeks 7-8 (Deload):** 50% volume reduction
- **Weeks 9-14 (Intensification):** Increase load, RPE 8-9, add techniques (rest-pause, drop sets)
- **Weeks 15-16 (Deload & Assessment):** 60% volume reduction, progress photos/measurements

### Key Principles
Progressive overload. Train close to failure. Rotate exercises every 4-6 weeks. 0.8-1g protein/lb, 10% calorie surplus.

## 3. Advanced — Powerlifting Peaking

**Split:** 4-Day Upper/Lower with Competition Lift Specificity  
**Focus:** Maximal strength development for competition peaking.

### Weekly Schedule
- **Mon:** Lower — Squat emphasis
- **Tue:** Upper — Bench emphasis
- **Wed:** Rest/mobility
- **Thu:** Lower — Deadlift emphasis
- **Fri:** Upper — Bench volume
- **Sat:** Optional technique work (50-60% 1RM)
- **Sun:** Rest

### Progression (12-Week Meet Prep)
- **Weeks 1-4 (Volume):** 4-5 sets of 4-6 reps @ 75-82% 1RM
- **Weeks 5-8 (Strength):** 4-6 sets of 2-4 reps @ 82-88% 1RM
- **Week 8 (Deload):** 60% volume reduction
- **Weeks 9-11 (Peaking):** 3-5 sets of 1-3 reps @ 87-95% 1RM
- **Week 12 (Meet Week):** Openers only Mon/Tue, rest Wed-Sat, compete Sunday

### Session Guidelines
- Competition lifts with RPE auto-regulation (target 7.5-8.5 during volume/strength, 8.5-9.5 during peaking)
- Specificity increases: 60% → 75% → 90% competition lifts across blocks
- Rest: 3-5min for competition lifts

### Key Principles
Specificity is king. Film every lift. Don't test maxes during Week 11. Opener = 90% gym max. Lower back conservation (cap deadlift at 8-12 sets/week).

## 4. Time-Constrained — Busy Professional

**Split:** 3-Day Full Body with Compound Focus and Density Training  
**Focus:** Strength maintenance and work capacity in 45-minute sessions.

### Weekly Schedule
- **3 sessions/week** (flexible M/W/F or T/Th/Sat)
- At least 1 rest day between sessions
- Days can shift based on schedule

### Session Structure (45min)
1. Warm-up (5min)
2. Compound Block (25min): 3-4 exercises, 3 sets of 5-8 reps @ RPE 7-8
3. Accessory Superset (10min): 2-3 exercises paired, 2-3 sets of 10-15 reps
4. Cool-down (5min)

### Progression (8-Week Wave Loading)
- **Weeks 1-3:** 3 sets of 6-8 reps (moderate volume)
- **Week 4:** Deload (2 sets, 80% working weight)
- **Weeks 5-7:** 3 sets of 5-6 reps (increase weight 5-10lbs)
- **Week 8:** Deload
- Repeat cycle

### Key Principles
Consistency over perfection. Time discipline (set a timer). No junk volume. If you miss a day, don't double up. NEAT focus (stairs, walking meetings).

## 5. Sport-Specific — MMA Fighter

**Split:** 3-Day Concurrent Training (Strength + Power + Conditioning)  
**Focus:** Power development, alactic capacity, and strength maintenance for 8-week fight camp.

### Weekly Schedule
- **Mon:** Lower Body Power + Alactic Conditioning
- **Tue:** MMA Training
- **Wed:** Upper Body Strength + Anti-Rotation Core
- **Thu:** MMA Training (Sparring)
- **Fri:** Full Body Explosive + Fight Simulation Conditioning
- **Sat:** MMA Training (Sparring/Open Mat)
- **Sun:** Rest/Recovery

### Session Structure (60min each)
- **Session 1:** Trap bar jumps → Trap bar deadlift/Safety bar squat → KB swings → Plyometrics → Alactic sprints (8x10sec)
- **Session 2:** Bench/Landmine press → Rows/Pull-ups → Med ball rotational throws → Pallof press → Grip work
- **Session 3:** Power cleans/Hang snatch → Plyo push-ups → Jump squats → Fight simulation (3x5min rounds) → Turkish get-ups

### Progression (8-Week Camp)
- **Weeks 1-3 (Strength):** 4x5 @ 80-85% 1RM
- **Weeks 4-5 (Power):** 3x3 @ 85-90%, increased explosive work

- **Week 8 (Taper):** Light strength Mon/Tue, technical MMA Wed, rest Thu, weigh-in Fri, FIGHT Sat

### Key Principles
Strength training enhances MMA, not competes with it. Power over hypertrophy (stay in weight class). Shoulder safety (no strict overhead press). Technique wins fights. Trust the taper.
