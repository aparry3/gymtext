Warm-up: 5min cardio + dynamic stretches\n2. Squat pattern (e.g., Goblet Squat, Leg Press)\n3. Hinge pattern (e.g., Dumbbell RDL, Cable Pull-Through)\n4. Horizontal Push (e.g., Dumbbell Bench Press, Push-ups)\n5. Horizontal Pull (e.g., Seated Cable Row, Chest-Supported Row)\n6. Vertical Push OR Pull (alternating)\n7. Core stabilization (Planks, Dead Bugs, Bird Dogs)\n8. Cool-down: 5min stretching\n\n**Cardio/Conditioning Protocol:**\n- Optional Zone 2 cardio post-workout: 10-15min easy effort\n- Weekend active recovery: low-intensity movement for enjoyment\n\n**Anchor Integration:**\n- No fixed anchors. Program is flexible to shift days within M/W/F framework if needed.\n\n## PROGRESSION STRATEGY\n\n**Method:** Linear Load Increase (beginner linear progression)\n\n**Cadence:**\n- Weeks 1-4: Focus on form mastery. Add weight only when form is clean for all reps.\n- Weeks 5-8: Increase load by 5-10lbs when you hit 3 sets of 15 reps with perfect form.\n- Weeks 9-12: Continue load increases or add complexity (e.g., single-leg variations).\n\n**Skill Milestones:**\n- Week 1-2: Learn movement patterns with light loads\n- Week 3-4: Build confidence with moderate loads\n- Week 5-8: Progressive overload with consistent form\n- Week 9-12: Introduction to barbell lifts (squat, deadlift, bench press)\n\n## DELOAD PROTOCOL\n\n**Trigger:** Every 4th week OR if experiencing unusual fatigue/soreness\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Reduce volume by 40-50% (drop to 2 sets per exercise)\n- Keep intensity moderate (stick with current weights, don't push for new PRs)\n- Focus on movement quality and active recovery\n\n## KEY PRINCIPLES\n\n1. **Form First:** Never sacrifice technique for weight. Film lifts if possible.\n2. **Consistency Over Intensity:** Showing up 3x/week is more important than perfect sessions.\n3. **Recovery Awareness:** Sleep 7-9 hours, eat adequate protein (0.7-1g per lb bodyweight).\n4. **Equipment Progression:** Start with dumbbells/machines, progress to barbells by Week 9.\n5. **Injury Prevention:** No pain (muscle soreness is OK, joint pain is NOT). Scale back if anything feels wrong.\n6. **Habit Building:** Track workouts in a simple log. Celebrate small wins (first full push-up, first barbell squat, etc.).\n7. **Patience:** Expect slow, steady progress. This phase builds the foundation for years of training."

    "content": "## PROGRAM ARCHITECTURE\n\n**Split Strategy:** 4-Day Upper/Lower with Competition Lift Specificity\n**Rationale:** Upper/Lower split allows 2x frequency on squat, bench, and deadlift while managing systemic fatigue. Optimal for advanced peaking cycle.\n**Primary Focus:** Maximal strength development via progressive overload and competition-specific adaptations.\n\n## WEEKLY SCHEDULE TEMPLATE\n\n- **Day 1 (Monday):**\n  - **Focus:** Lower Body — Squat emphasis\n  - **Activity Type:** Resistance Training (Competition squat + accessories)\n  - **Rationale:** Fresh start to the week for primary squat volume.\n\n- **Day 2 (Tuesday):**\n  - **Focus:** Upper Body — Bench emphasis\n  - **Activity Type:** Resistance Training (Competition bench + pressing volume)\n  - **Rationale:** Mid-week upper session allows recovery from squat.\n\n- **Day 3 (Wednesday):**\n  - **Activity Type:** Rest or light mobility work\n\n- **Day 4 (Thursday):**\n  - **Focus:** Lower Body — Deadlift emphasis\n  - **Activity Type:** Resistance Training (Competition deadlift + posterior chain)\n  - **Rationale:** Positioned mid-week to allow recovery before weekend squat volume.\n\n- **Day 5 (Friday):**\n  - **Focus:** Upper Body — Bench volume\n  - **Activity Type:** Resistance Training (Bench variations + overhead work)\n  - **Rationale:** Second bench day with slightly different intensity/volume profile.\n\n- **Day 6 (Saturday):**\n  - **Activity Type:** Optional technique work or rest\n  - **Note:** Light squat/deadlift technique drills if feeling recovered (50-60% 1RM for skill maintenance)\n\n- **Day 7 (Sunday):**\n  - **Activity Type:** Rest\n\n## SESSION GUIDELINES\n\n**Competition Lift Training:**\n- **Weeks 1-4 (Volume Block):**\n  - Squat: 4-5 sets of 4-6 reps @ 75-82% 1RM\n  - Bench: 4-5 sets of 5-8 reps @ 72-80% 1RM\n  - Deadlift: 3-4 sets of 3-5 reps @ 75-82% 1RM (conservative volume due to injury history)\n  \n- **Weeks 5-8 (Strength Block):**\n  - Squat: 4-6 sets of 2-4 reps @ 82-88% 1RM\n  - Bench: 5-6 sets of 3-5 reps @ 80-87% 1RM\n  - Deadlift: 3-5 sets of 2-4 reps @ 82-88% 1RM\n  \n- **Weeks 9-11 (Peaking Block):**\n  - Squat: 3-5 sets of 1-3 reps @ 87-95% 1RM\n  - Bench: 4-6 sets of 1-3 reps @ 87-93% 1RM\n  - Deadlift: 2-4 sets of 1-2 reps @ 87-93% 1RM\n  \n- **Week 12 (Meet Week):**\n  - Openers only (Monday/Tuesday), rest Wed-Sat, compete Sunday\n\n**Accessory Work:**\n- Competition variations: 2-3 sets of 5-8 reps (pause squats, close-grip bench, deficit deadlifts)\n- Weak point targeting: 3 sets of 8-12 reps (e.g., hamstring curls for deadlift lockout, tricep work for bench)\n- Core/stability: 2-3 sets (ab wheel, planks, bird dogs)\n\n**Rest Periods:**\n- Competition lifts: 3-5min between sets (full recovery for quality)\n- Accessories: 2-3min\n- Isolation: 60-90sec\n\n## PROGRESSION STRATEGY\n\n**Method:** Linear Periodization with Auto-Regulation\n\n**Weekly Progression:**\n- Volume Block (Weeks 1-4): Increase weight by 2.5-5lbs weekly OR add 1 rep to top set\n- Strength Block (Weeks 5-8): Increase intensity by 2-3% weekly, reduce reps slightly\n- Peaking Block (Weeks 9-11): Reduce volume by 20-30% while pushing intensity to 90-95%\n\n**RPE Auto-Regulation:**\n- Prescribed percentages are guidelines. If RPE is >9 on a set, reduce load by 5%.\n- If RPE is <7, add 2.5-5lbs.\n- Goal: Hit prescribed reps at RPE 7.5-8.5 during volume/strength, RPE 8.5-9.5 during peaking.\n\n**Specificity Increase:**\n- Weeks 1-4: 60% competition lifts, 40% variations\n- Weeks 5-8: 75% competition lifts, 25% variations\n- Weeks 9-11: 90% competition lifts, 10% variations (minimal accessories)\n\n## DELOAD PROTOCOL\n\n**Scheduled Deload:** Week 8 (between Strength and Peaking blocks)\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Volume: Reduce by 60% (cut sets in half)\n- Intensity: Keep at 70-75% 1RM (no heavy singles)\n- Exercise selection: Competition lifts only (no accessories)\n- Purpose: Dissipate accumulated fatigue before final peaking block\n\n**Meet Week Taper (Week 12):**\n- Monday: Competition squat + bench, openers only (1-2 reps @ 85-90%)\n- Tuesday: Competition deadlift, opener only (1 rep @ 85%)\n- Wed-Sat: Complete rest (mobility/stretching only)\n- Sunday: COMPETE\n\n## KEY PRINCIPLES\n\n1. **Specificity is King:** As meet approaches, reduce variation and focus on exact competition movements (including commands, pauses, ROM).\n2. **Manage Fatigue:** Advanced lifters accumulate fatigue quickly. If feeling beat up, take an extra rest day. Missing 1 session won't hurt; injury will.\n3. **Lower Back Conservation:** Given injury history, cap deadlift volume at 8-12 total work sets per week. Supplement with RDLs, good mornings.\n4. **Technical Mastery:** Film every competition lift. Fix form issues immediately—don't grind through bad reps.\n5. **Peak Week Discipline:** Do NOT test maxes during Week 11. Trust the process. Save PRs for the platform.\n6. **Recovery Optimization:** Sleep 8-9 hours, eat at maintenance or slight surplus, minimize life stress during final 4 weeks.\n7. **Mental Preparation:** Visualize successful attempts. Practice meet-day routine (warm-up protocol, attempt selection strategy).\n8. **Attempt Selection Strategy:** Opener = 90% of gym max (guaranteed make). Second attempt = PR attempt (realistic). Third attempt = dream PR (stretch goal)."

Compound-dominant programming maximizes efficiency.\n**Primary Focus:** Strength maintenance and work capacity via high-density training.\n\n## WEEKLY SCHEDULE TEMPLATE\n\n- **Day 1 (Monday OR Tuesday):**\n  - **Focus:** Full Body — Lower emphasis\n  - **Activity Type:** Resistance Training (Squat, Hinge, Push patterns)\n  - **Rationale:** Start week with lower-body dominant session.\n\n- **Day 2 (Tuesday OR Wednesday):**\n  - **Activity Type:** Rest or optional 15-20min walk\n\n- **Day 3 (Wednesday OR Thursday):**\n  - **Focus:** Full Body — Upper emphasis\n  - **Activity Type:** Resistance Training (Push, Pull, Squat patterns)\n  - **Rationale:** Mid-week session with upper-body focus.\n\n- **Day 4 (Thursday OR Friday):**\n  - **Activity Type:** Rest\n\n- **Day 5 (Friday OR Saturday):**\n  - **Focus:** Full Body — Balanced\n  - **Activity Type:** Resistance Training (All patterns, higher volume)\n  - **Rationale:** End-of-week session balances all movement patterns.\n\n- **Day 6 (Saturday OR Sunday):**\n  - **Activity Type:** Optional Active Recovery (30min walk, bike ride, yoga)\n\n- **Day 7 (Sunday):**\n  - **Activity Type:** Rest\n\n**Flexibility Note:** Training days can shift within the week based on schedule. Maintain at least 1 rest day between sessions. Minimum 3 sessions/week; if you miss a day, don't double up—just continue the sequence.\n\n## SESSION GUIDELINES\n\n**Workout Structure (45min total):**\n1. **Warm-up (5min):** Dynamic stretches, light cardio, mobility drills\n2. **Compound Block (25min):** 3-4 exercises, minimal rest, high intensity\n3. **Accessory Superset (10min):** 2-3 exercises paired for efficiency\n4. **Cool-down (5min):** Stretching, foam rolling\n\n**Training Technique:**\n- **Compound Lifts:** 3 sets of 5-8 reps @ RPE 7-8\n  - Rest: 2-3min between sets (timed strictly)\n  - Focus: Squat, Deadlift, Bench, Row, Overhead Press variations\n  \n- **Accessories:** Superset pairs (A1/A2), 2-3 sets of 10-15 reps @ RPE 8\n  - Rest: 60-90sec between supersets\n  - Antagonist pairing (e.g., leg curl + calf raise, bicep curl + tricep extension)\n\n**Exercise Selection Each Session:**\n- 1 Squat pattern (Back Squat, Front Squat, Goblet Squat, Bulgarian Split Squat)\n- 1 Hinge pattern (Deadlift, RDL, Hip Thrust)\n- 1 Horizontal Push (Bench Press, DB Press, Dips)\n- 1 Horizontal Pull (Barbell Row, DB Row, Cable Row)\n- 1 Vertical Push OR Pull (OHP or Pull-ups) — alternating\n- 1-2 Accessory supersets (core, arms, calves, delts)\n\n**Cardio/Conditioning Protocol:**\n- Not structured into program (minimal time available)\n- Optional: Weekend walks, bike rides, active hobbies\n- NEAT focus: Take stairs, walk meetings, stand desk\n\n## PROGRESSION STRATEGY\n\n**Method:** Linear Periodization with Simplified Wave Loading\n\n**Weeks 1-3 (Moderate Volume):**\n- Compounds: 3 sets of 6-8 reps\n- Accessories: 2 sets of 12-15 reps\n- Goal: Re-establish baseline, build work capacity\n\n**Week 4 (Deload):**\n- Compounds: 2 sets of 6-8 reps @ 80% of working weight\n- Accessories: 2 sets of 10-12 reps\n- Goal: Active recovery, dissipate fatigue\n\n**Weeks 5-7 (Strength Emphasis):**\n- Compounds: 3 sets of 5-6 reps (increase weight by 5-10lbs from Weeks 1-3)\n- Accessories: 3 sets of 10-12 reps\n- Goal: Push intensity up while maintaining volume\n\n**Week 8 (Deload):**\n- Same as Week 4\n\n**Repeat Cycle:** Continue 3-week waves with gradual load increases.\n\n**Progression Rules:**\n- If you hit 3 sets of 8 reps cleanly, add 5-10lbs next session.\n- If you fail to hit minimum reps (5 reps) on all sets, reduce weight by 5-10lbs.\n- Prioritize consistent execution over chasing PRs.\n\n## DELOAD PROTOCOL\n\n**Frequency:** Every 4th week\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Reduce volume by 33% (drop to 2 sets per exercise)\n- Reduce intensity by 20% (use 80% of working weights)\n- Keep exercise selection the same\n- Maintain session structure (same timing, same patterns)\n\n**Optional Deload (if life gets crazy):**\n- If you can only train 2 days in a week, treat it as an unscheduled deload.\n- Return to normal schedule the following week without guilt.\n\n## KEY PRINCIPLES\n\n1. **Consistency Over Perfection:** 3 sessions of 45min beats 1 session of 2 hours. Show up reliably.\n2. **Compound-Centric:** 80% of your results come from squat, hinge, push, pull. Prioritize these ruthlessly.\n3. **Time Discipline:** Set a timer. Stick to rest periods. If a workout runs over 50min, cut an accessory—don't sacrifice sleep or work.\n4. **Flexible Scheduling:** Life happens. If you miss Monday, train Tuesday. Don't skip a session because it's not the \"right\" day.\n5. **Efficient Accessories:** Supersets save time without sacrificing quality. Pair non-competing movements (e.g., biceps + calves).\n6. **Recovery Awareness:** With 3 days/week, recovery is built in. Prioritize sleep (7-8 hours) and protein (0.8g per lb bodyweight).\n7. **No Junk Volume:** Every set should have a purpose. If an exercise doesn't serve the goal, cut it.\n8. **Long-Term Sustainability:** This is a marathon, not a sprint. Strength maintenance > chasing unsustainable gains.\n9. **Progress Tracking:** Keep a simple log (sets, reps, weight). Celebrate small wins (e.g., hit 5lbs more on squat for same reps).\n10. **Mindset Shift:** You're not \"settling\" for 3 days—you're optimizing for your life. Elite athletes train less frequently than you think."

If you're too sore to spar, reduce volume.\n2. **Power Over Hypertrophy:** Focus on explosive intent, not muscle growth. Stay within weight class.\n3. **Concurrent Periodization:** Balance strength, power, and conditioning across the week. Don't stack hard sessions back-to-back.\n4. **Shoulder Safety:** Avoid heavy strict overhead press. Use landmine press, push press, or horizontal pressing instead.\n5. **Conditioning Specificity:** Fight simulation intervals (3x5min) mimic fight structure. Use Assault Bike, Rower, or circuit work.\n6. **Recovery Priority:** Sleep 8-9 hours, eat at maintenance calories (high protein, moderate carbs for training fuel), manage stress.\n7. **Technical Skill First:** If you have to choose between strength and sparring, choose sparring. Technique wins fights.\n8. **Taper Discipline:** Week 8 is about arriving fresh, not \"getting one more session in.\" Trust the taper.\n9. **Grip Strength:** Critical for grappling. Include dead hangs, farmer's carries, and thick-bar work.\n10. **Mental Prep:** Visualize fight scenarios. Use breathwork to manage adrenaline. Stay calm under fatigue."
