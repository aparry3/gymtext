# Time-Constrained — Busy Professional Examples

Reference examples for the Time-Constrained plan (3-day full body with supersets, 8 weeks).

## Plan Characteristics

- **Name:** Time-Constrained — Busy Professional
- **Split:** 3-Day Full Body (Compound Focus + Density Training)
- **Frequency:** 3 days/week (flexible scheduling: any 3 non-consecutive days)
- **Duration:** 8 weeks
- **Primary Focus:** Strength maintenance and work capacity in 30-45min sessions
- **Progression:** Simplified wave loading (3 weeks on, 1 week deload)
- **Target Audience:** Busy professionals with limited time, maintain strength efficiently

## Week Selection Rationale

**Week 1 (Foundation, Mon/Wed/Fri):**
- Learn superset technique and pacing
- RPE 6-7 (60-65% loads, leave 3-4 RIR)
- 30-35min session time
- 3 supersets (compounds + accessories paired)
- Focus: Master transitions (<15sec between exercises)

**Week 4 (Progressive Overload Mid, Tue/Thu/Sat):**
- RPE 7-8 (70-75% loads, leave 2-3 RIR)
- 35-40min session time
- Flexible scheduling demonstrated (Tue/Thu/Sat vs Mon/Wed/Fri)
- Optional 4th superset introduced (advanced trainees)
- Focus: Increase loads while maintaining session time

**Week 6 (Progressive Overload Final, Mon/Wed/Fri):**
- RPE 7-8 (75-80% loads, leave 2-3 RIR)
- 35-45min session time
- Mental prep for Week 7 (final test week before deload)
- Focus: Confidence building, Week 8 deload preview

## Superset Structure for Time Efficiency

**Superset Format:**
```
A1. Exercise 1 (10-12 reps)
<15sec transition
A2. Exercise 2 (10-12 reps)
60-90sec rest
Repeat 3 times
```

**Time Savings:**
- Traditional: Exercise 1 (3 sets × 90sec rest) + Exercise 2 (3 sets × 90sec rest) = ~10.5min
- Superset: A1+A2 (3 rounds × 90sec rest) = ~7.5min
- **Result:** 30% time savings with same total work

**Transition Rules:**
- <15sec between A1 and A2 (don't dawdle, but don't rush form)
- 60-90sec rest between supersets (full recovery for quality)
- Non-competing muscle groups (e.g., upper/lower, push/pull, compound/core)

## Wave Loading Progression

**Weeks 1-3 (Moderate Volume):**
- Compounds: 3 sets × 6-8 reps
- Accessories: 2 sets × 12-15 reps
- Goal: Build work capacity, establish baseline

**Week 4 (Deload):**
- Compounds: 2 sets × 6-8 reps @ 80% working weight
- Accessories: 2 sets × 10-12 reps
- Goal: Active recovery

**Weeks 5-7 (Strength Emphasis):**
- Compounds: 3 sets × 5-6 reps (+5-10lbs from Weeks 1-3)
- Accessories: 3 sets × 10-12 reps
- Goal: Push intensity while maintaining volume

**Week 8 (Deload):**
- Same as Week 4

## Flexible Scheduling Philosophy

**Week 1:** Mon/Wed/Fri (traditional)
**Week 4:** Tue/Thu/Sat (demonstrates flexibility)
**Week 6:** Mon/Wed/Fri (bookends approach)

**Key Principle:** "Any 3 non-consecutive days work"
- Life happens—if you miss Monday, train Tuesday
- Don't skip because it's not the "right" day
- Maintain 1 rest day between sessions minimum

## Optional Components

**4th Superset (Week 4+):**
- Advanced trainees only
- 2 sets (not 3)
- Adds ~5min to session
- "Main supersets are priority—this is bonus work"

**Cardio Finishers (All Weeks):**
- 5-16min, truly optional
- Week 1: 5min (short intro)
- Week 4: 10min (mid-program)
- Week 6: 16min (pre-peak conditioning)
- "Main work takes priority—skip if time is tight"

## Progressive Overload with Specific Examples

**Load Progression Guidance:**
- "If Week 5 you squatted 155lbs×10 @ RPE 7-8, try 165lbs×10 or 155lbs×12"
- Concrete weight/rep examples in every workout
- Demonstrates +10-20lbs or +2-5 reps across weeks

**Week 1 → Week 6 Load Increases:**
- Squat: +130% (115lbs → 265lbs)
- Deadlift: +74% (135lbs → 235lbs)
- Shoulder Press: +80% (30lbs → 55lbs)
- Push-ups: +67% resistance (bodyweight → feet elevated or weighted vest)
- Plank: +33-100% difficulty (30-45sec → 45-60sec or weighted)

## Comparison: Week 1 vs Week 6

| Dimension | Week 1 (Foundation) | Week 6 (Pre-Peak) |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| RPE | 6-7 (60-65% loads) | 7-8 (75-80% loads) |
| Session time | 30-35min | 35-45min |
| Supersets | 3 (required) | 3 (required) + optional 4th |
| Cardio finisher | 5min (optional) | 16min (optional) |
| Mental framing | "Learn pacing" | "Visualize Week 7 success" |
| Focus | Technique mastery | Confidence building |

## Usage

These examples demonstrate:
- Superset-based time efficiency (30% time savings)

- Compound-centric programming (80% results from big lifts)
- Optional components (4th superset, cardio finishers)
- Progressive overload with concrete examples
- Realistic session times (30-45min)
- Sustainable programming for busy professionals
