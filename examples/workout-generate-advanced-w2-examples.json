Execution: Push floor away with legs (don't yank bar with back), bar scrapes shins and thighs (stays in contact with body entire lift—if bar drifts forward you lose leverage), hips and shoulders rise together (don't shoot hips up first—turns deadlift into stiff-leg and strains back), lockout with glutes (stand tall, squeeze glutes, don't lean back excessively or hitch). Lower with control (don't drop aggressively—controlled descent prevents injury). Focus: Perfect setup every single rep, bar speed (if rep takes >4-5sec or you feel back starting to round, stop set), breathing and bracing between reps. Record: weight, reps, RPE per set, bar speed notes, any form issues (hips shot up? back rounded? bar drifted forward?).",
