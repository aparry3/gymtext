Execution: Descend with control (2-3sec, don't dive), hit depth (parallel or below), pause 0.5sec at bottom (maintain tension, don't relax), DRIVE explosively (push through floor, hips and chest rise together). Focus: Speed off the bottom (if you're slow out of the hole, power is lost). Bar speed check: first rep should move well, second rep slows slightly, third rep is hard but should complete in <3sec. If third rep grinds excessively or stalls, weight is too heavy—reduce 10lbs next set. Rest 3-4min between sets (sit down, sip water, mentally reset). Record: weight, reps completed, RPE per set, bar speed on each rep (fast/moderate/slow/grind), depth confidence, any form breakdown (chest collapse? hips shoot up?).

Breathe at top. Focus: Maintain arch and shoulder blade position throughout set, bar touches same spot every rep (lower sternum), bar path diagonal (not straight up), lockout fully. Bar speed check: first rep should move well, second rep slows, third rep is challenging but should complete without mid-press stall. If bar stalls or takes >3sec, reduce 5lbs next set. Rest 3-4min (sit up, sip water, shake out arms, mentally prepare). Record: weight, reps, RPE, bar speed per rep, bar path quality, any form breakdown (arch collapse? bar path drift?).",

Execution: Push floor away with legs (don't yank with back), bar scrapes shins/thighs (stays in contact entire lift—if drifts forward, lose leverage), hips and shoulders rise together (don't shoot hips up first—strains back), lockout with glutes (stand tall, squeeze glutes, don't lean back excessively or hitch). Lower with control (controlled descent prevents injury). Focus: Perfect setup EVERY rep, bar speed (if second or third rep is significant grind—takes >4-5sec, form breaks down, back rounds—stop set and reduce 10lbs next set). Reps: Some lifters can do 3 clean reps, others only 2—listen to your body. If first rep is RPE 9.5, do NOT attempt second rep (injury risk). Rest 3-4min (sit down, release belt if wearing, sip water, mentally reset—deadlifts are as mental as physical at 82.5%). Record: weight, reps completed (2 or 3?), RPE per set, bar speed per rep, any form breakdown (back rounding? hips shot up? hitching? bar drifted forward?), grip (did grip hold or slip?).",
