Don't pace yourself evenly—replicate fight intensity (bursts of high output followed by moderate work). Purpose: Multi-modal conditioning (legs, posterior chain, full body, upper body), fight-specific pacing, mental toughness, lactate tolerance. Week 7: PEAK volume (5 rounds vs 2 rounds in Week 1, 3 rounds in Week 4). You should finish feeling like you just went 5 rounds of a fight. If you don't, intensity wasn't high enough. Fighter-specific: This IS your fight conditioning. If you can push through Round 5 here, you can push through Round 5 in the cage. Mental Note: Rounds 3-5 are where fights are won.
