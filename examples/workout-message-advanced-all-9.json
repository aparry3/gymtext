If Week 1 felt RPE 7, add 5-10lbs today. Focus on bar speed—if it slows significantly on reps 4-5, reduce next set. Track: weight, reps, RPE, bar speed notes. Session: ~85min."

Perfect setup critical (feet, arch, shoulder blades). If Week 1 felt easy, add 5lbs. Upper back work (rows/face pulls) prevents shoulder issues. Session: ~80min."

Week 7 will be hardest, then Week 8 deload. Session: ~80min."
