Focus on mastering superset pacing: transition between exercises in <15sec, rest 60-90sec after completing BOTH exercises. Loads are moderate (60-65%) to allow focus on technique. Don't rush through exercises—move deliberately between them. Session: ~30-35min. Optional 5min row finisher if time/energy allows."

Introduce barbell deadlift (bar speed fast, form perfect). Compare transition times to Monday—getting more efficient? If gasping for air or form breaks down, extend rest to 2min and dial back intensity. Session: ~30-35min. Optional 5min jump rope if time allows."
