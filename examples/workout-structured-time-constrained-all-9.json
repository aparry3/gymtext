Today you'll learn superset technique: pair two exercises with minimal transition time (<15sec between exercises, 60-90sec rest between supersets). Loads are moderate (60-65%, RPE 6-7) to allow focus on pacing and form. Session time: 30-35min. Key goal: master the transitions without sacrificing movement quality.",

Execution: Curl dumbbells to shoulder height (don't swing or use momentum), squeeze biceps at top for 1sec (emphasize contraction), control descent to full elbow extension (2-3sec eccentric). Keep elbows pinned to sides—don't let them drift forward. Week 6 progression: If Week 5 you used 30lb dumbbells×12, try 35lb×12 or 30lb×15. This is your final progressive overload curl session before Week 7's peak test. Curls respond well to volume and time under tension—if weight jump feels too big, add reps and slow down eccentric (2-3sec descent). Focus: Bicep contraction, strict form. No body English—if you need to swing, weight is too heavy. Purpose: Bicep strength, elbow flexion pattern, arm development.",
