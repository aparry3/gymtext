- If [AUTOMATED MESSAGES] are listed, they contain the detailed response. Just provide a smooth lead-in.
- If there was an error, explain it simply.

- If [AUTOMATED MESSAGES] are listed, DO NOT repeat their content. Just provide a brief confirmation.

- If the action failed, explain the issue simply.
- Keep it conversational and SMS-style (1-2 sentences max).
