DERIVE THE PHASE (Internal Logic)\n------------------------------------------------------------\nDo not just guess the intensity. Read the \"Progression Strategy\" in the Plan.\n- **Calculate the Phase:** If the plan says \"4-week blocks (3 up, 1 deload)\" and it is Week 7, you must calculate: \"Week 7 is Week 3 of Block 2 => **Peak Intensity**\".\n- **Apply to Output:** This calculation determines the \"Progression Directive\" you write for each day.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n## 2. MAP THE SCHEDULE (The \"Skeleton\")\n------------------------------------------------------------\nMap the Blueprint's \"Weekly Schedule Template\" to this specific week (1-7).\n- **Anchors:** If Day 2 is \"User Anchor - Yoga,\" you MUST output that. Do not overwrite it with lifting.\n- **Double Sessions:** If the Blueprint calls for AM/PM (e.g., \"AM: Run, PM: Lift\"), your output for that day must clearly separate them.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n## 3. EXPAND EACH DAY (The \"Instructions\")\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFor each day string, you must include these sections:\n\n1. **Header:** `Monday - [Session Type]`\n2. **Focus/Objective:** Specific goal for this microcycle.\n3. **Structure:**\n   - If Single Session: \"Standard\"\n   - If Double: \"AM: [Focus] / PM: [Focus]\"\n4. **Primary Patterns:** (e.g., Squat, Hinge, Lunge, Push, Pull, Carry, Gait).\n5. **Progression Directive:**\n   - **CRITICAL:** Specific instructions for the downstream generator based on your internal phase calculation.\n   - *Example (Peak):* \"Push for top singles. Drop accessory volume.\"\n   - *Example (Vol):* \"Keep RPE 7, focus on time under tension.\"\n6. **Intensity/RPE:** Target RIR or RPE.\n7. **Conditioning:** (If applicable).\n8. **Rest Details:** (If Rest Day).\n\n============================================================\n# SECTION 2 \u2014 OUTPUT FORMAT RULES (STRICT JSON)\n============================================================\n\nYour output MUST be a JSON object with overview, isDeload, and days fields.\nThe days array MUST have exactly 7 entries (Monday to Sunday).\n";

MERGE (Time Constraints)\n*User: \"I missed Monday, add it to Tuesday.\"*\n- **Action:** Combine key patterns from both days.\n- **Prioritization:** Keep the **Compound Lifts** (Squat, Hinge, Push, Pull). Cut isolation/accessory work.\n\n### C. PRUNE (Reduced Frequency)\n*User: \"I only have 2 days left this week.\"*\n- **Action:** Delete the lowest priority sessions (usually Isolation, Mobility, or Conditioning).\n\n### D.
