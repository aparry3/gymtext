# Phase 1: Cleanup & Reorganization - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Phase 1 of the test scripts reorganization has been successfully completed. The scripts directory now has a clean, organized structure that will support the new fitness plan architecture.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created New Directory Structure ✅
```
scripts/
├── migrations/         # Database migration scripts
├── test/              # Organized test scripts
│   ├── user/          # User management
│   ├── fitness/       # Fitness plans
│   ├── messages/      # Messaging
│   └── flows/         # End-to-end flows
├── utils/             # Shared utilities
├── docker/            # Docker scripts
└── archive/           # Deprecated scripts
```

### 2. Moved Migration Scripts ✅
- `create-migration.ts` → `migrations/create.ts`
- `migrate.ts` → `migrations/run.ts`

### 3. Moved Docker Scripts ✅
- `run-tests.sh` → `docker/run-tests.sh`

### 4. Archived Old Scripts ✅
Moved to `archive/` for replacement:
- `get-test-user.ts` (replaced by utils/db.ts)
- `test-programs.ts` (to be replaced in Phase 3)
- `test-user-flow.ts` (to be replaced in Phase 5)
- `test-cron-daily-messages.ts` (to be replaced in Phase 4)

### 5. Kept and Reorganized ✅
- `test-sms.ts` → `test/messages/sms.ts`
- `test-checkout.ts` → `test/user/checkout.ts`

### 6. Created Base Utility Modules ✅

#### utils/config.ts
- Environment configuration management
- API endpoint helpers
- Test user defaults
- Environment detection

#### utils/db.ts
- Database access singleton
- User lookup methods
- Fitness plan queries
- Progress tracking helpers
- Workout retrieval
- Cleanup utilities

#### utils/users.ts
- User creation via API
- Profile management
- User deletion for cleanup
- Active user listing
- User details display

#### utils/common.ts
- Display utilities (tables, headers, separators)
- Timing utilities
- Phone number parsing
- Test data generators
- Spinner and progress indicators

### 7. Updated package.json ✅
Updated all script paths to reflect new structure:
- Migration scripts now reference `migrations/`
- Docker scripts reference `docker/`
- Test scripts reference `test/`

### 8. Documentation ✅
- Created `scripts/README.md` with complete documentation
- Created `docs/UPDATE_SCRIPTS.md` with full update plan

## Verification
- ✅ Lint passes with new structure
- ✅ All scripts properly moved/archived
- ✅ Utilities ready for use in new scripts
- ✅ Package.json correctly updated

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
Ready to implement user management scripts:
1. `test/user/create.ts` - Interactive user creation
2. `test/user/get.ts` - User lookup and display
3. `test/user/profile.ts` - Profile updates

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
2. **Reusability**: Shared utilities reduce duplication
3. **Maintainability**: Logical structure easy to navigate
4. **Consistency**: Common patterns across all utilities
5. **Documentation**: Clear README and usage examples

## No Breaking Changes
- Existing `test:sms` and `test:checkout` still work
- Migration scripts still functional
- Docker scripts still operational
- All archived scripts preserved for reference
