# Phase 3: Fitness Plan Scripts - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Phase 3 has been successfully completed with three comprehensive fitness management scripts that support the new fitness plan architecture with mesocycles, progress tracking, and on-demand workout generation.

## Completed Scripts

### 1. Fitness Plan Creation Script (`test:fitness:plan`) ✅
**Location**: `scripts/test/fitness/create-plan.ts`

**Features**:
- ✅ Generate fitness plans via API
- ✅ Display comprehensive mesocycle structure
- ✅ Show plan overview and notes
- ✅ Check for existing plans with override option
- ✅ Validate user has fitness profile
- ✅ Progress tracking initialization
- ✅ JSON export for automation

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Create plan by phone number
pnpm test:fitness:plan --phone "+1234567890"

# Create plan by user ID
pnpm test:fitness:plan --user-id "abc123"

# Specify program type
pnpm test:fitness:plan --phone "+1234567890" --type strength

# Create 12-week plan
pnpm test:fitness:plan --phone "+1234567890" --weeks 12

# Override existing plan
pnpm test:fitness:plan --phone "+1234567890" --force

# Export as JSON
pnpm test:fitness:plan --phone "+1234567890" --json > plan.json
```

### 2. Progress Tracking Script (`test:fitness:progress`) ✅
**Location**: `scripts/test/fitness/progress.ts`

**Features**:
- ✅ View current mesocycle and week position
- ✅ Display progress visualization with percentage
- ✅ Show current microcycle pattern
- ✅ Calculate overall progress with visual bar
- ✅ Advance to next week (placeholder for API)
- ✅ Reset progress option (placeholder for API)
- ✅ Display upcoming milestones
- ✅ JSON export for tracking

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# View current progress
pnpm test:fitness:progress --phone "+1234567890"

# Advance to next week
pnpm test:fitness:progress --phone "+1234567890" --advance

# Reset progress
pnpm test:fitness:progress --phone "+1234567890" --reset

# Set specific week
pnpm test:fitness:progress --phone "+1234567890" --week 3

# View detailed progress
pnpm test:fitness:progress --phone "+1234567890" --verbose

# Export as JSON
pnpm test:fitness:progress --phone "+1234567890" --json
```

### 3. Workout Generation Script (`test:fitness:workout`) ✅
**Location**: `scripts/test/fitness/workout.ts`

**Features**:
- ✅ Retrieve existing workouts by date
- ✅ Display workout blocks with exercises
- ✅ Show sets, reps, duration, and intensity
- ✅ Display modifications and notes
- ✅ View weekly training pattern
- ✅ Force regenerate option
- ✅ Structured table display for exercises
- ✅ JSON export for integration

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Get today's workout
pnpm test:fitness:workout --phone "+1234567890"

# Get workout for specific date
pnpm test:fitness:workout --phone "+1234567890" --date "2024-01-15"

# Force regenerate workout
pnpm test:fitness:workout --phone "+1234567890" --force

# Show weekly training pattern
pnpm test:fitness:workout --phone "+1234567890" --pattern

# Export as JSON
pnpm test:fitness:workout --phone "+1234567890" --json > workout.json
```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Alignment
All scripts align with the new fitness plan architecture:
- **Mesocycles**: Stored as JSON in fitness plans table
- **Progress Tracking**: Uses currentMesocycleIndex and currentMicrocycleWeek
- **Microcycles**: Pattern stored in separate table
- **Workouts**: Generated on-demand with block structure

### Display Features
- **Mesocycle Tables**: Clear visualization of training phases
- **Progress Bars**: Visual representation of completion
- **Workout Blocks**: Structured display of exercises
- **Pattern Display**: Weekly training schedule view

### Integration Points
- Uses utility modules from Phase 1
- Integrates with user management from Phase 2
- Prepared for message testing in Phase 4
- Ready for end-to-end flows in Phase 5

## Features Delivered

### Plan Management
- Create fitness plans with program type specification
- Override existing plans with force flag
- Display comprehensive mesocycle breakdown
- Initialize progress tracking automatically

### Progress Visualization
- Current position in plan (mesocycle/week)
- Overall progress percentage with visual bar
- Upcoming milestones display
- Weekly pattern visualization

### Workout Structure
- Block-based workout display
- Exercise details with sets/reps/intensity
- Modifications for injuries/limitations
- Pattern-based generation support

## Testing & Verification

### Build & Lint Status
- ✅ **Build passes** - No TypeScript errors
- ✅ **Lint passes** - No ESLint warnings
- ✅ **Package.json updated** - All commands added
- ✅ **Environment loading** - Proper .env.local sourcing

### Manual Testing Completed
- ✅ Plan creation with various options
- ✅ Progress display and visualization
- ✅ Workout retrieval and display
- ✅ JSON export functionality
- ✅ Error handling for missing data

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full coverage of fitness plan features
2. **Visual Clarity**: Tables and progress bars for easy understanding
3. **Flexibility**: Multiple input methods (phone/ID) and output formats
4. **Integration Ready**: Prepared for message and flow testing
5. **Architecture Aligned**: Supports new on-demand generation model

## Ready for Phase 4
With fitness plan management complete, the foundation is ready for:
- Daily message testing with workout generation
- Batch message processing
- Schedule management
- SMS interaction testing

## No Breaking Changes
- All existing scripts continue to work
- New functionality is additive
- Database schema unchanged
- API endpoints unchanged
