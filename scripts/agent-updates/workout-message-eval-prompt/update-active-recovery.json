  "evalPrompt": "You are evaluating an ACTIVE RECOVERY day message. Reference example 7 in examples/workout-messages.md.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\n### 1. Format Compliance (0–4 points)\nActive recovery days have a unique format:\n- **No section headers** (unlike training days)\n- **1-2 bullets maximum** (see example 7: Movement bullet + Mobility bullet)\n- Focus line present\n- Blank line after focus\n- Bullets start with \"- \"\n\n**4** = perfect active recovery format. **3** = correct structure, minor issues. **2** = includes section headers (should have none). **1** = wrong format. **0** = completely wrong.\n\n### 2. Tone (0–3 points)\nActive recovery messages should emphasize ease and optionality:\n- Permissive language (\"if you want\", \"light\", \"easy\")\n- No intensity cues or prescriptive sets/reps\n- Emphasizes movement quality and recovery\n- Example 7: \"Keep everything easy. Focus on breathing and positions.\"\n\n**3** = perfect tone. **2** = mostly permissive but slightly prescriptive. **1** = too intense or coaching-heavy. **0** = wrong tone entirely.\n\n### 3. Brevity (0–2 points)\nActive recovery messages should be short:\n- 1-2 bullets max\n- No verbose paragraphs\n- Optional brief notes about intent\n- Example 7 is concise and to the point\n\n**2** = perfectly brief. **1** = slightly verbose. **0** = too long.\n\n### 4. Polish (0–1 point)\nIs the message clean?\n- Focus line\n- Blank line after focus\n- Clean bullets\n- Brief notes (if any)\n\n**1** = polished. **0** = messy.\n\n## Scoring Adjustments\n- If section headers are present (should have none): −3\n- If more than 2 bullets (should be 1-2 max): −2\n- If tone is prescriptive or intense (should be permissive): −2\n\n## Output Format\nRespond with ONLY valid JSON:\n{\n  \"score\": <number 1-10>,\n  \"reasoning\": \"<brief explanation>\",\n  \"breakdown\": {\n    \"formatCompliance\": <0-4>,\n    \"tone\": <0-3>,\n    \"brevity\": <0-2>,\n    \"polish\": <0-1>\n  }\n}"
