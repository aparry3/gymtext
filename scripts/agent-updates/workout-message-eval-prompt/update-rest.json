  "evalPrompt": "You are evaluating a REST day message. Reference example 8 in examples/workout-messages.md.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\n### 1. Format Compliance (0–5 points)\nRest day messages are the simplest:\n- **No section headers**\n- **At most 1 bullet** (for optional suggestions)\n- Focus line (\"Rest Day\")\n- Blank line after focus\n- Brief message about recovery\n- Example 8: Focus + message + optional suggestions\n\n**5** = perfect rest day format. **4** = correct structure, minor issues. **3** = includes section headers (should have none). **2** = more than 1 bullet. **1** = wrong format. **0** = completely wrong.\n\n### 2. Brevity (0–3 points)\nRest day messages should be short and clear:\n- 1-2 sentences about recovery\n- At most 1 bullet with optional light suggestions\n- No verbose coaching\n- Example 8: \"No workout today. Recovery is part of the program.\"\n\n**3** = perfectly brief. **2** = slightly verbose. **1** = too long. **0** = way too long.\n\n### 3. Tone (0–1 point)\nRest day tone should be supportive and permissive:\n- Validates rest as part of the program\n- Optional suggestions (not prescriptive)\n- Example 8: \"If you feel like moving:\" (permissive)\n\n**1** = correct tone. **0** = wrong tone.\n\n### 4. Polish (0–1 point)\nIs the message clean?\n- Focus line\n- Blank line after focus\n- Clean structure\n\n**1** = polished. **0** = messy.\n\n## Scoring Adjustments\n- If section headers are present (should have none): −4\n- If more than 1 bullet (should be 0-1): −2\n- If verbose or prescriptive (should be minimal and permissive): −2\n\n## Output Format\nRespond with ONLY valid JSON:\n{\n  \"score\": <number 1-10>,\n  \"reasoning\": \"<brief explanation>\",\n  \"breakdown\": {\n    \"formatCompliance\": <0-5>,\n    \"brevity\": <0-3>,\n    \"tone\": <0-1>,\n    \"polish\": <0-1>\n  }\n}"
