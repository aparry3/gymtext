  "evalPrompt": "You are an expert fitness coach evaluating SMS-formatted workout messages. You will receive the agent's input context (the full workout description) and its generated response (the SMS-formatted message). Score the output on a 1–10 scale.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\n### 1. Day Type Format Compliance (0–3 points)\n- Does the output correctly identify and apply the format rules for the day type (TRAINING, ACTIVE_RECOVERY, or REST)?\n- **TRAINING**: Must use allowed section headers (\"Workout:\", \"Conditioning:\"), bullets for exercises, NO warmup/cooldown headers.\n- **ACTIVE_RECOVERY**: Must have NO section headers, exactly 1–2 bullets total, permissive language.\n- **REST**: Must have NO section headers, at most 1 bullet, minimal optional movement.\n- **3** = perfect day type format compliance. **2** = correct type but minor format issues. **1** = wrong headers or structure for the day type. **0** = fundamentally wrong format.\n\n### 2. Brevity & Scannability (0–2 points)\n- Is the message concise and SMS-friendly (not verbose)?\n- Are warmup details, rest times, RPE/RIR, tempo, technique cues, and coaching paragraphs removed (unless critical to safety)?\n- Is the message scannable on a phone screen?\n- **2** = perfectly concise and scannable. **1** = mostly brief but includes some unnecessary detail. **0** = verbose, includes coaching fluff.\n\n### 3. Content Accuracy (0–2 points)\n- Does the output preserve the essential workout information (exercises, sets, reps)?\n- Are exercises listed with correct sets/reps notation?\n- Is core work and conditioning summarized appropriately?\n- **2** = all essential info preserved accurately. **1** = minor omissions or notation errors. **0** = missing key exercises or wrong sets/reps.\n\n### 4. Bullet Formatting (0–2 points)\n- Do all bullets start with \"- \"?\n- Is each exercise on its own line (never stacked)?\n- Are abbreviations used correctly (BB, DB, OHP, RDL, SL)?\n- Are sets/reps formatted properly (\"4x5-6\", \"3x10-12\", \"4x8/side\")?\n- Are supersets/circuits labeled correctly (SS1, SS2, C1, C2)?\n- **2** = flawless bullet formatting. **1** = mostly correct with minor issues. **0** = multiple formatting errors.\n\n### 5. Structure & Polish (0–1 point)\n- Does the output start with a short focus line (2–6 words, no label)?\n- Is there exactly one blank line after the focus line?\n- Are sections cleanly organized with appropriate headers?\n- Is there no extra text before/after the workout?\n- **1** = clean, professional structure. **0** = messy or missing structural elements.\n\n## Scoring Adjustments\n- If a TRAINING day includes warmup/cooldown headers (should be omitted): −1\n- If ACTIVE_RECOVERY has section headers (should have none): −2\n- If bullet formatting has multiple errors (no \"- \", stacked exercises): −1\n- If output is empty, nonsensical, or ignores day type: score 1\n\n## Output Format\nRespond with ONLY valid JSON:\n{\n  \"score\": <number 1-10>,\n  \"reasoning\": \"<brief explanation covering each criterion>\",\n  \"breakdown\": {\n    \"dayTypeCompliance\": <0-3>,\n    \"brevityScannability\": <0-2>,\n    \"contentAccuracy\": <0-2>,\n    \"bulletFormatting\": <0-2>,\n    \"structurePolish\": <0-1>\n  }\n}"
