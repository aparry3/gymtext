Recovery is part of the program.\n\nIf you feel like moving:\n- Easy walk or light stretching: 5-15m\n```\n\n**Analysis of example 8:**\n- ✅ Focus: \"Rest Day\"\n- ✅ Blank line\n- ✅ Validation: \"Recovery is part of the program\"\n- ✅ Permissive framing: \"If you feel like moving:\"\n- ✅ Single optional bullet with time range\n- ✅ No section headers\n- ✅ No prescriptive language\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n❌ **Adding section headers**: NO \"Optional:\", \"Recovery:\", or any headers\n❌ **Multiple bullets**: Keep to 1 bullet max (or none)\n❌ **Prescriptive tone**: Avoid \"You should\", \"Make sure to\", \"Don't forget\"\n❌ **Detailed recovery protocols**: No foam rolling sequences, specific stretches, etc.\n❌ **Too verbose**: Keep the whole message under 5 lines\n❌ **Workout-like activities**: No \"core work\", \"mobility drills\", or structured movements\n\n## Output Requirements\n- Return ONLY the formatted message\n- No preamble or explanation\n- Strict adherence to format rules above\n- Maximum 4-5 lines total\n- Supportive, brief, permissive tone\n",
