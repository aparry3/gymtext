  <Goal>
  Return **exactly one JSON object** that conforms to the FitnessProgram schema
  (the schema is pre-loaded via the system and includes:
  • a top-level "overview" string,
  • macrocycles → mesocycles → weeklyTargets → (optional) microcycles).
  </Goal>
  
  <Schema highlights>
  • Each \`WeeklyTarget\` must now include **split** — a short text blueprint of
    the weekly pattern (e.g. "Upper-Lower-HIIT-Rest").  
  • \`metrics\` and \`targets\` use arrays of { key, value } pairs (Gemini-safe).  
  • Objects are strict – no extra keys; no \`$ref\`; depth ≤ 5.  
  </Schema highlights>
  
  <Content guidelines>
  - Use ${user.name}'s fitness profile (see below) for goals, experience,
    schedule and equipment.
  - Build **one macrocycle** that spans the requested timeframe.
  - Inside it, create **mesocycles** of 3-6 weeks.
    • Give each mesocycle a \`weeklyTargets\` array that shows progressive
      overload (2-3 build weeks) followed by a deload week.  
    • Every element **must** contain \`split\`.
  - Leave \`microcycles\` as empty arrays – they will be generated later.
  - The \`overview\` (plain English) should be upbeat, ≤ 120 words.
  - Output **only** the JSON object wrapped in a single \`\`\`json … \`\`\` block.

Client Name: Aaron
Fitness Plan Overview: Hey Aaron, great to connect with you! I've put together a preliminary overview of a workout plan designed to help you crush your goals of losing weight, building muscle, boosting your endurance, and achieving overall fantastic fitness. Given your advanced skill level and commitment to training four times a week, we're going to create a dynamic and challenging program that will deliver excellent results. Our approach will be a well-structured combination of different training modalities to keep things engaging, maximize fat loss, stimulate muscle growth, and significantly improve your cardiovascular capacity. Here’s what you can expect as the primary components of your training plan: Comprehensive Strength Training: We'll incorporate compound exercises targeting major muscle groups (think squats, deadlifts, presses, rows) along with isolation exercises to sculpt and define specific muscles. Given your advanced level, we'll focus on progressive overload, varied rep ranges, and potentially incorporate advanced techniques like supersets or drop sets to maximize muscle hypertrophy and strength gains. Strategic Cardiovascular Exercise: To torch calories, improve your endurance, and enhance cardiovascular health, we'll integrate a mix of steady-state cardio and potentially more intense interval training. This will ensure we're effectively burning fat while building a strong aerobic base. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): Knowing your advanced level, HIIT will be a powerful tool in our arsenal. These short bursts of intense exercise followed by brief recovery periods are incredibly effective for fat loss and boosting your metabolic rate. We'll strategically incorporate HIIT sessions to complement our strength training. Dedicated Flexibility and Mobility Work: To ensure optimal recovery, prevent injury, and improve your overall movement quality, we'll include regular stretching and mobility exercises. This might involve dynamic stretching before workouts and static stretching afterward, as well as specific exercises to address any areas of tightness or limited range of motion. This overview provides a general framework. As we move forward, we'll develop detailed weekly schedules that will specify the exact exercises, sets, reps, and rest periods. I'm really excited to work with you, Aaron, and I'm confident that with your dedication, we'll achieve remarkable progress together! Let's get started!

Expected Output:
